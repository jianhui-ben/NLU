0,B0026RQTGE,5,addictive! but works for night coughing in dogs,"my 12 year old sheltie has chronic brochotitis, been on meds for three years, these help with the coughing fits at night. so I like them!!!<br /> one bite and both my dogs are addicted!!! be warned!!! 7 pm both shelties are on my lap howling for the drug fix! I am a dog trainer and have never seen  anything like it....<br /><br />three weeks later,, the beloved sheltie got a bowel blockage from these, use with caution.<br />if the cat gets too many she has the runs....<br />sheltie did better when i upped her thryoid meds, and gave her doggie asthma meds.<br />so it worked better for the 18 year old cat, who also has asthma."
1,B0026RQTGE,5,genuine Greenies best price,"These are genuine Greenies product, not a knockoff.  My dogs love them!  It is their favorite treat.  I have 2 small dogs, both under 10 lbs. and the Teenie size is perfect for them.  I paid $22.37 for this 96-pack and it is by far the best price I have found anywhere.  I wish these were part of the Subscribe & Save program."
2,B0026RQTGE,5,Perfect for our little doggies,"Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't?  I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect!  A great price for a great product.  Who could ask for more."
3,B0026RQTGE,5,dogs love greenies,"What can I say, dogs love greenies. They begg for them all the time. They always sit by the cupboard and ask for more."
4,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies review,This review is for a box of Greenies Lite for my dog. The package came quickly and was packaged appropriately. I was very satisfied with this purchase and with the seller.
5,B0026RQTGE,5,Magic Breath Chews for your dog,I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!
6,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for Seniors,I have always used Greenies for my dogs. THese for seniors are wonderful. I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.
7,B0026RQTGE,5,Kinda Pricy but good!,"If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product."
8,B0026RQTGE,5,DOG LOVES THESE,"I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth."
9,B0026RQTGE,5,Great treat and good for dental health,"This is a fabulous treat for my little cavalier king charles. He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears."
10,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love these chews!,"I am the lucky parent of three dogs. I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon."
11,B0026RQTGE,5,Awesome!,This is a great product. My 2 year old Golden Retriever hates to have his teeth brushed and this product made his teeth white again. Great seller and great price too!
12,B0026RQTGE,4,My cat loves the dog greenies,"I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door."
13,B0026RQTGE,4,whiten your dogs teeth,"Greenies are an excellant way to whiten your dogs teeth. The costs were much lower here, than what you can buy locally at the dog food stores. They have made a great improvment in my dog(s) breath, tarter and overall mouth smell!"
14,B0026RQTGE,4,Dogs love them - Owners hate paying for them!,"My dogs are addicted to these things and it's my fault.  Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe."
15,B0026RQTGE,4,likes it,"this product does help to cleen the teeth, but doesnt really help to get rid of the bad breath of my pom..But still a good buy, cause the size is perfect for small breed dogs"
16,B0026RQTGE,4,My dogs' teeth are pearly white,"My dogs love their Greenies, and their teeth are pearly white from chewing on them.  The only problem is that Greenies are expensive, so I buy them in bulk on Amazon to keep the prices down a little bit,"
17,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these,My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.  My dog is a chewer so it works out great.  She is addicted!
18,B0026RQTGE,5,Our dog loves her Greenies!,"Super fast shipping, even included a couple trial treats.  Our dog loves these and we'll be purchasing them again!"
19,B0026RQTGE,5,Good Deal for my Good Dog,My dog looks forward to a Greenie dessert everyday.  You will NOT find this deal at the local pet stores.  I love the fact that I get a good deal at Amazon.  I save time and gas.  My dog thanks us both.
20,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"Perform as promised.  No problems with ""blobs"" since my dog chews 'em up real well."
21,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them!,"Great treat for all doggies, very healthy and they adore them.  Excellent and fast shipping,will buy again."
22,B0026RQTGE,5,Teenie Greenies,"My little dogs really like these ""teenie"" Greenies dental chewies. Not only are they good for the dogs' teeth, the dogs consider them a treat! I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are ""petites"" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!"
23,B0026RQTGE,5,Expensive treats but my dogs LOVE them!,"I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say ""Time for your Greenies!"" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive."
24,B0026RQTGE,5,Very happy with purchase,I was very happy with the quick delivery and how I was given a tracking method to determine where my Greenies were. I'll telling my friends and relatives about the good experience.
25,B0026RQTGE,4,My Dog Loves Them,What can I say my dog goes crazy over these things - wish I really understood what are in them that makes it so desirable...now if we could only do this for vegetables so kids would be excited!!
26,B0026RQTGE,5,My Silky Terrier loves these!,"He weighs 15 pounds, so he is just at the top of the range for the teenie size Greenies.  He likes them so much, he would probably prefer the Jumbo size!  I've given him these for his whole life, so I don't know if they get his teeth any cleaner than without them, but his teeth look pretty clean to me!"
27,B0026RQTGE,5,Great for dog breath and teeth,Ive been buying this product for a few years and am very happy with it. My dog loves them.
28,B0026RQTGE,4,My dog LOVES these,"Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies.  I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else."
29,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,Stopped being able to find large quantities locally so glad that Amazon has vendors who are selling them at a great price.
30,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenie Review,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBFKIQ"">Greenies Dental Chews - 27 ounce Box - Petite - 45 count</a> Very good product delivered promptly at a fair price. Will order more from this site."
31,B0026RQTGE,4,Great for picky eaters,My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product. The only bad thing is that it will make your dog fat if he eats too much.
32,B0026RQTGE,1,Check Contents First,"Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.  Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog.  This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness."
33,B0026RQTGE,3,"Dogs love them, but I don't think they love dogs","I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product."
34,B0026RQTGE,3,Wrong size,"I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times  before thru Amazon.  This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.  The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it!  After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat.  Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day!  I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.<br />I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled!"
35,B0026RQTGE,5,A great deal on Greenies,Paid only $22 with free shipping for 96 teenies compared to about $35 at the pet store. How can you go wrong with a deal like that?  The dog begs for his daily Greenie. Got to have them.
36,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for Dogs,"How well the dogs would eat them.  Glad to know the benefits the animals get from chewing them, both for teeth cleaning and breathe.  Safety us always an issue."
37,B0026RQTGE,1,very dangerous product for dogs,"i bought this for my dog - he loved it.  however, i noticed that he stopped pooping and came to realize (after googling) that it caused him to be constipated.  His stomach was very bloated and I could feel that his colon was obstructed by something -- a piece of undigested greenies treat.  I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!  This product is really dangerous and I would love to join in on a class action lawsuit against this unethical company.  They have made greenies 'tasty' but that is all it is.  a tasty but dangerous product."
38,B0026RQTGE,5,Best doggie treat,"I buy the teenie greenies and break them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a ""lite"" version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing, but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do."
39,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog loves Greenies,Greenies are always a good product.  Our dog loves them and reminds us if we forget to give him one.  Plus I love the price on Amazon and can't always get them locally.
40,B0026RQTGE,5,Great teeth,My vet is always surprised how clean my 8 year old dog's teeth are and I attribute this the his daily Greenie.
41,B0026RQTGE,5,radtechmom,Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!
42,B0026RQTGE,5,my dogs love these,"In September, I adopted 2 adult border terrier mixes from The Shelter Pet project and the oldest girl had a few ""breath"" issues.  Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar. Amazon has much better pricing then the pet centers, so I love it.  Try them for your pet, they will love it."
43,B0026RQTGE,4,My Yorkie Loves them!,This is the first time I bought this product for my 9 yr old yorkie... and she loved it!  The small size is perfect for her.  This box of greenies will give her many days of enjoyment!
44,B0026RQTGE,5,Puppies love them!,"These tinnie greenies make the perfect ""out the door"" bribe for my Cavlier King Charles Babies. I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store."
45,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dog Says YUMMMMM,"My Chihuahua has horrible horrible breath.... and she loves to get in your face and give kisses to everyone. These help, and she loves to eat them. Good thing she can't reach the counter!"
46,B0026RQTGE,4,Good,"My dog likes thse alot..He runs to his bedroom to eat them, which is reserved for just his special treats..Can't say his breath is any better but he just started eating them a month ago,or so.."
47,B0026RQTGE,3,Jumbo Greenies-Good but Very Expensive,"Bought the Jumbo Greenies for my Black Lab. He loved them, but at $2.66 each they are way too expensive for regular use.  Didn't notice any difference in breath which was the primary reason for buying."
48,B0026RQTGE,4,Dogs liked 'em!,Our two thirteen year dogs like these.  They're prone to major tartar build up on their teeth and these helped some and made their breath better.  I never expected these to polish the teeth perfectly but they made a bad condition not so bad.
49,B0026RQTGE,5,Cleaner dog mouth,"This is a good product. My dog likes them, Makes it obvious he wants his greenie every night. Amazon sells them at good price and quality has always been good"
50,B0026RQTGE,5,A treat that is good for the teeth,I have a two year old chihuahua mix.My vet shared with me that I would have to be vigilant about the health of my Pups teeth.Greenies help keep my dogs teeth clean and his breath fresh. And best of all my Pups loves them above all other treats.
51,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves them,Great product.  My dog loves the bones and they come in a ziplock bag inside the box.  Just like the ones at the store and much cheaper at Amazon.
52,B0026RQTGE,5,OUR DOGS LOVE THEM,"Our Chussel's Love these toothbrush treats. When I ask them if they want to brush their teeth, they jump a mile high to get them. It dosent help their breath to to much, but I know its keeping their teeth clean. Also these are a little on the expensive side almost everywhere, Amazon has the best price. Thanks Amazon."
53,B0026RQTGE,5,Excellent product!,"I have two 6 month old dobemans who asked me to rate Greenies 6 out of five. It is yet to be seen how it will improve their dental health, but as far as their excitement about this particular treat - it is the best, no doubt."
54,B0026RQTGE,5,Love It!!,"Great product, it was exactly what I wanted.  I ordered the medium size because my shi tzu LOVES greenies so much! Good deal for the price considered how expensive they are at petco!!"
55,B0026RQTGE,5,great product,"Had been buying greenies at the pet store for the past 7 years, best price on sale was $32.99. These are a great value."
56,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Senior,"Great service, great product, our dogs LOVE them!  Great for their teeth, and it keeps them from eating grass if they have one first thing in the morning!"
57,B0026RQTGE,5,Oliver's must have greenies,My little Oliver loves his greenies.......He gets 1 everymorning thanks to such a good buy we are sure to have them every day.........
58,B0026RQTGE,5,What my dogs have to say . . .,"Anytime I shout out ""Mr. Greenie! Four dogs come running, ages 12 to 2. My dogs love them and they do seem to help with breath and tarter. Amazon has the absolute best prices."
59,B0026RQTGE,5,Wonderful service and product,This is a wonderful product that my dog really loves.  there is only one thing to make this product better - 30 chews in the box so we would have one for every day of the month.
60,B0026RQTGE,5,Simply The Best,Greenies are my pups number one favorite treat.  He loves them and they help keep his teeth clean. I reccomend these to anyone who wants to spoil their pet.
61,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves Greenies,"These are a great size for an evening snack.  My dog loves them and ""insists"" on having one or two every night."
62,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,We are very pleased with our purchase of Greenies.  The price was grteat (compared with the pet stores) and the service was excellent.  Our dog is even more pleased than we are - he loves them.
63,B0026RQTGE,5,"An 'attention getter' for our ""hotdog""","Our mini Dachshund loves these. Limited to 1 a day. One of the few ""treats"" that he has not tired of. Also, his breath has been noticeably fresher since he has been having these. So far, best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs. Can't vouch on the benefit of nutritional value of these, but the vet says our mini is in great shape ...right where he is suppose to be."
64,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs like it,Not only my logs like these snacks... ME TOO because their mouth isn't stinky anymore! ;) I will keep on buying it because of that reason. DOG LOVERS: you will like this product.
65,B0026RQTGE,4,Last bag had 1 big greenie ball,"I've been using this product for almost 2 years and my dogs seem to like it.  However, last box/bag had all 96 greenies stuck together in a huge ball.  Maybe it was the heat or maybe something happened during packaging.  Either case, I have to pull off 1 at a time when it comes to snack time."
66,B0026RQTGE,5,PICCOLO LOVES THESE,"My little Papillon, Piccolo absolutely LOVES these. I no longer have to try to brush his teeth every evening and he smells delicious when I kiss him good night. I'LL BE GETTING THESE FROM YOU FOR AS LOG AS WE BOTH MAY LIVE!<br /><br />THANK YOU, AMAZON!!!!!"
67,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them! And good for them!,They're a great product and automated delivery at great prices can't be beat!  My dogs go crazy when it comes to greenie time at night.  No matter how many nights we do the same thing they are always over the top for greenies
68,B0026RQTGE,5,My boys love greenies!!!,I have 2 small dogs and one really small dog.  They all get one Greenie a day.  They LOVE their greenies!1 I love that the Greenies help to keep their mouths fresh and clean. They are adorable and are shaped like a mini toothbrush!!!
69,B0026RQTGE,5,Reorder of Greenies,Greenies are given to both of my Westies and they expect one a day when they complete their morning routine.  Best treat ever.
70,B0026RQTGE,5,love my litttle dogs,My little ones love their teenie greenies. It is so easy to order them from Amazon. Greenies are recomendid by my vet to help keep my dachshunds teeth clean and healthy.
71,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them!,Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.
72,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog Loves!,My dog loves these treats and they are lite too.  I have been buying them for the last 5 years
73,B0026RQTGE,3,Good for breath,"These bones are great for a dog's breath. However, I was looking for something that would take him more than a minute to chew. Still a good treat for doggy breath."
74,B0026RQTGE,5,Why do they increase the price each month on the product?,I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases.  If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94.  Why the increase?  Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.<br /><br />The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible.
75,B0026RQTGE,5,My Puppy Loves These,"Einstein our puppy loves the Greenies.  He get's one at night before bed as a bribe for going into his kennel.  Works wonders:)  Since, he gets one every night we go through the Greenies fairly quickly.  I like the larger size and was actually cheaper per piece.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8"">Greenies 27 oz Canister Teenie 96 Count</a>"
76,B0026RQTGE,4,A noticeable difference in dental health,"I've only given Greenies four stars because they're pretty costly at one Greenie per day (and we have two dogs).  That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon."
77,B0026RQTGE,5,My vet suggested this.,My two dogs love these.  Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013.
78,B0026RQTGE,5,Very pleased,"Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag."
79,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,My dog looks forward everyday to getting his Greenies.  It is a great toothbrush and keeps him from having too much tarter on his teeth.
80,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love em!,"I am always concerned with my dogs oral health. I have found that my dogs love the Greenies and they do a good job of helping to keep the tarter build up off their teeth! I have one dog that is very particular about his treats and what he will chew on but he loves the Greenies, in fact my dogs will do most anything I ask so long as they know they get a Greenie afterwards!"
81,B0026RQTGE,5,Instead of brushing~,Always had trouble trying to brush my dog's teeth; thought I would try the Greenies Petite (16 lb cockapoo). They are plenty big enough. She has one everyday loves them and her teeth are looking very healthy; no tartar build up. Definitely recommend them.
82,B0026RQTGE,5,Highly recomended,"My dog love it, and She's a very, very picky eater- even with treats. So, this product must have a great flavor."
83,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love Greenies,"Both of my small breed dogs love their greenies treat and I like that it is good for their dental health,,"
84,B0026RQTGE,4,catnip for dogs?,"my german shepherd goes crazy for these things. i have no idea why he likes them so much. his breath is always pretty good, so i guess these work well. good deal for the scheduled delivery option."
85,B0026RQTGE,4,freshens breath,"I have a (now) 6 month old miniature daschund puppy. I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!"
86,B0026RQTGE,5,"Jumbo Dog, Jumbo Greenies","We have been feeding these to our do since he became an adult dog.  We feed him the Jumbo size Greenies. He's 125+ pounds and devours them in seconds.  We order them from Amazon, because we can rarely find the Jumbo size greenie canisters in stores.  Our dog's teeth seem to be in really good condition.  We have never had any problems with him eating them or with his digestion.  We always give him one when we are around to watch and he's never had any issues."
87,B0026RQTGE,5,Like going to the dentist,"I bought these for my 9 yr old dog because the vet said she had stage 4 dental disease, and we really couldn't afford the $300+ price of teeth cleaning for her. I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the pet store."
88,B0026RQTGE,5,Good for older dogs as well for younger,"I have a 10yr. old boxer and she has worn much of her teeth down some what.  She loves these and they help her breath and clean her teeth.  If she likes them, then MoM likes them."
89,B0026RQTGE,5,suscribe to GreeniesMy,"My Boston Terrier gets one Greenie regular each day to keep teeth clean. Should I forget it's time for her Greenie, she sits and stares at me until I remember. Vet says her teeth are in great shape."
90,B0026RQTGE,5,Patches loves these!,Patches loves these and will put up with teeth brushing since he knows he'll get a Greenie at the end of it.
91,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Green Snack,"My dog loves them, and so does our vet?  Our Yorkie likes to eat unhealthy things, but shys away from healthy ones.  The lone exception are Greenies."
92,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies-teenie 96 pack,"My dog loves these snacks.  I have a smaller rat terrier mix dog she loves these even more than Cherrio's.  They come in a canister which is flimsy but I threw it away as they are also in a resealable bag. They should last a fairly long time as I don't give them to her daily, only for special treats and after she takes any medicines."
93,B0026RQTGE,5,Teeny greenies,"I have been buying 96-count containers of teeny greenies from Amazon for a couple of years.  They are always fresh and arrive promptly. My Yorkies look forward to one before bedtime each evening.  I don't know if they really help plaque.  They do freshen breath and have some nutrition.  Thanks to Amazon prices, my dogs have this little luxury."
94,B0026RQTGE,5,For Great Doggie Breath,"We have two shelties and their breath improved almost immediately with this product.  One of our dogs has a problem digesting another brand, but neither dog had a problem with the Greenies.  Highly Recommend."
95,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog will kill for a Greenie!,"Ever since I introduced my dog to Greenies, she just loved them. They are her favorite treats, and they are good for her too! She weighs about 15 pounds and I give her one each morning after her walk. I purchase the 27 oz canister, Teenie size (96 count)."
96,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love Greenies,This is a great treat for my dogs. I've been buying them for 12 years and they never turn it down.
97,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dogs Love These,"These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is ""do you want to brush your teeth"" and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape..."
98,B0026RQTGE,5,Love them,My dog loves these. I also bought them way cheaper than the pet store. Next time it's offered for the price I paid I will buy a few boxes again
99,B0026RQTGE,4,not bad,So far so good. My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot.
100,B0026RQTGE,5,Our Dogs LOVE These and We Do Too!,"I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!"
101,B0026RQTGE,5,my lil' beast is crazy for greenies!!,"i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1"
102,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them."
103,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."
104,B0026RQTGE,5,such great treats!,"I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up."
105,B0026RQTGE,4,"These seem so expensive, but they work!","My dogs, the 1st day I tried these, didn't really seem to like them. Now they practically climb up me to get to them. My older dog was having trouble with tarter and bad breathe.  After 2 weeks of using the treats, her teeth looked a lot better and the nasty odor was gone.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the expense, which for me is times 2."
106,B0026RQTGE,5,It's like crack for dogs...,"First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs..."
107,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love Greenies!,My dogs love them and they really help in freshening my dogs' breaths! This is the most cost-efficient pack I could find.
108,B0026RQTGE,5,Treats for Pepper,"We have been buying Greenies for Pepper for about 4 years.  He has a very sensitive stomach and can only have boiled chicken and canned and dry prescription diet ID<br />I brush his teeth every night and afterwards he gets a ""greenie""  he loves them and I love that they don't upset his stomach.<br />Our Vet said they should be ok for Pepper.  And they are.  Paying about 40.00 elsewhere, I'm really happy to find them on Amazon.com for a little over half of that.  Pepper is happy and I'm happy."
109,B0026RQTGE,5,Addictive to dogs,"It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it."
110,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Greenies,"My dog no longer needs to have his teeth cleaned by the vet, since he gets one grenie every day."
111,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,Both of my German Shepherds love their daily Greenies.  Matty jumps up on my bed at noom every day to remind me to get off my butt and produce her treat!
112,B0026RQTGE,5,"Excellent deal,Very affordable price",Since I have three dogs buying treats can get very spendy. I am so glad that I shop at Amazon.com they offer such great deals for me as wells for my little four legged kids. Truthfully I have to say that I have been extremely satisfied with all of my purchases . I am grateful that Amazon offers such wonderful deals Thank you
113,B0026RQTGE,5,very good,"my dog love it very much, the fist thing that she wake up in the morning is eat the greenies!"
114,B0026RQTGE,5,Breath chews are awesome although vets say hooey,These treats for small dogs are #1 on my dog's list of morning must haves.<br />She has been pestering me to give her a morning teenie chewy every day for many<br />months. She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.<br />I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good breath.<br />Maybe they just limit the amount of bad breath. Whatever. This box is a three<br />month supply so is a reasonably economical way to give my dog something she really likes.
115,B0026RQTGE,5,I am not exaggerating...,"Little Lulu, my six month old Miniature Scnauzer, developed foul breath. It reeked like a dead fish, and I couldn't handle her puppy kisses any more.  Then, I saw an ad on TV for a competing product, but found these to be a better deal. They are worth every penny.<br /><br />The Teenie Greenies arrived yesterday. Just ONE solved the problem. I gave it to her half expecting her to turn her nose up. Instead, she loved it. This morning she greeted me with sloppy kisses and wiggles. I instinctively cringed, waiting for that fetid smell. But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada."
116,B0026RQTGE,5,Teenie Greenie,Dogs love greenies. Awesome product. Super price. Item was shipped very rapidly. Great packaging. Overall wonderful experience. All animals are happy!
117,B0026RQTGE,5,love it!!!,My dog thinks it is crack! He is crazy over these teenie greeinies. Arived on time and cheeper than the store for sure. I would recomend to all.
118,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Chew Treat,Greenies are the special treat we give our golden retriever and great pyrenee/golden retriever mix.  Greenies are hard enough that our dogs have to chew slowly but not so hard that I feel uncomfortable giving it to them.
119,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dog LOVES These!,"Plain and simple, my dog loves these. She dances, spins, & squeaks whenever one is brought out! While this makes me happy as well, it is important to say that regular feedings of 1 to 2 a week have helped avoid teeth cleanings and extractions over the years! Too bad they don't have an equivalent for humans!"
120,B0026RQTGE,5,Great treats,"Penny loves it. She keeps asking for more and more :)<br />I was very glad to know that because its healthy, cheap and tasty. I definitely will buy more, next time!"
121,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves them and the Vet complimented my dog's teeth,"Started buying these for my dog and he loves them. They are easy on his teeth (not too hard, etc) and my vet complimented that his teeth are in good condition. Your dog may need teeth cleaning once in awhile (it's not a substitute) but it mitigates the tartar buildup effectively when given daily. Will buy over and over again."
122,B0026RQTGE,5,great treat! not too smelly,"For a picky boxer that doesn't like or eat many treats, she is addicted to these!  They aren't very chalky or too smelly and she enjoys the hard but soft enough texture for her big mouth/small teeth combo :)  These treats also don't leave any residue on the carpet which is very nice."
123,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Deal!,"I have 2 small dogs and buying this pack on Amazon saved a great deal of money! I was worried about them being outdated and dried out but I was wrong, I had one myself they were so fresh but for some reason now I have the urge to chase squirrels."
124,B0026RQTGE,5,The Best!,"My dog can't eat bully sticks or bones, so I have to find other treats.  She is also a bit overweight, so how can I beat Greenies Lite Treats?  The dog loves them and they are good for her teeth.  All around a perfect product."
125,B0026RQTGE,5,chew away!,My dog loves these and it keeps him busy for 5 minutes which is a long time for my chew hound!
126,B0026RQTGE,5,Great product,"My boxer likes these, but he doesn't get really excited about them.  But if they work as advertised and clean his teeth, then they are great."
127,B0026RQTGE,5,The picky boys' favorate,My dogs like this a lot. They are willing to do any tricks for this. They have it for over three years and still love it.
128,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Petite,"As with any dog treat, you must monitor your pet while consuming but Greenies are the best! My dogs know exactly when it is Greenie Time!"
129,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are the best,"I have a 6 pound toy poodle and she would be very depressed without her daily ration of greenies.  She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food, the greenie helps clean her teeth.  The price on these greenies is very good and they were fresh and came in a timely manner."
130,B0026RQTGE,4,STONE,"I LIKE GREENIES, MY DOGS LOVE GREENIES, AND GREENIES ARE A HEALTHY TREAT FOR MY PETS.  I HAVE BEEN BUYING GREENIES FOR FOUR YEARS.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT AMAZON SOLD GREENIEN UNTIL RECENTLY."
131,B0026RQTGE,5,Awesome Product,"These things are awesome.  These Greenies really clean your dog's teeth very well.  When I first opened the container I was a bit skeptical because they smelled pretty bad but after a week of using these.  My dogs breath was great, and I used to not be able to bear her breath.  It's a must buy for any pet owner."

133,B0026RQTGE,5,doggy chews,"If you need to keep your dogs mouth and gums clean and healthy, this will easily do the job.  My dog looks forward to this treat!"
134,B0026RQTGE,3,"Just Okay, nothing else","Updates: One Day, One Week, Two Weeks, One Month, Three Months, Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today, even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."
135,B0026RQTGE,5,Buy the sample size first!,"My pekingese loves these!She is known to be quite a picky eater,so I ordered the sample size( called a 'mini-treat pak' of the Greenies first to see if she'd like them.( I believe the sample size =22 of the 'Teenie' size). She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip-lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip-lock pouch.*It also is a great way to bring some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQCJIG"">Greenies Treats for Dogs (5-15 lbs/2-7 kg)Mini Treat-Pak-Teenie 6 oz</a>"
136,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love these!!,"As soon as my dogs hear that I open the box they come running.  They absolutely love these chews! Don't know what it is, but they're irresistable to my dogs!"
137,B0026RQTGE,3,"Dogs love it, but it caused upset tummies","I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning."
138,B0026RQTGE,4,Love 'em!,"I buy these directly from amazon because they're always cheaper than I can find them at local pet stores. My dog goes absolutely crazy for the Greenies Lite. I'd originally started him off on the normal greenies but switched to the Lite about a year ago and he loves these just as much. I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.<br /><br />I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund/pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go broke if I gave him as many as he could eat. As long as the box is fresh, the greenies will be nice and bendable... I have purchased a box on a few occasions where the greenies were rock hard.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price. I just wish they were a tad lower. Even still, I will keep buying these as they're my dog's fave treats."
139,B0026RQTGE,4,Lily & Lolas Fun Chews,Received the Greenies and immediately gave 1 to each of my dogs. Lola chewed hers right away and loved it. Lily hides hers and then eats it later. Nice size and good price. Both dogs enjoy Greenies.
140,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog's love them,"I order these constantly for my dogs, and my review is always the same:  Most dogs think they are the best thing since grass, and will do all kinds of tricks to get them."
141,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies - the best price anywhere.,This is the best price for Greenies.  Greenies do a great job helping to keep my dog's teeth in their best shape.  So glad I discovered this product on Amazon as they are almost too expensive to buy anywhere else.
142,B0026RQTGE,2,Dog got sick,Been buying greenies for years.  Decide to try the senior version but it made my dog sick.  I don't know if its to soft or what but it seemed to get stuck in his throat that he'd eat some grass to throw it up.  Bummed since I bought a tub.
143,B0026RQTGE,5,My doggies love these,"My two dachshunds love these things.  They know they are going to get one every morning.  They lead me to the pantry and are so cute when they beg or I call it talking, letting me know that they can't hardly wait.  Great product."
144,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,Thank you so much for sending us this product that our dogs love so much! It was neatly packaged and enjoyed by the dogs the minute we opened the package. The deal is amazing!
145,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Price,Our yorkie and shitzu love greenies and the price at amazon is significantly lower than what I can find at petsmart or Petco. I will continue to buy from Amazon
146,B0026RQTGE,4,My dog loves these,"Greenies are one of my English Bulldog's favorite treats.  They are a bit on the expensive side, but if you get them on Amazon instead of one of the large Pet stroe chains, you get a better deal.  I tried the Costco brand of dental chews (they were about half the price) and they disagreed with my dog's stomach so I came back to Greenies.  I usually break them in half and put it in is kong toy so it's like a puzzle for him to get it out.  If I just give it to him he eats it really quickly.  Overall, Greenies are a great product."
147,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for a picky eater,"I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills."""
148,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog's favorite treat!,"Greenies are great dental chews that keep my dog with minimal plaque.<br />My 3 yr old loves it.<br />The price of the 96 Teenie Pack (or more) from Amazon is unbeatable.<br /><br />Of note, my dog didn't like it very much when he tried it the first time when he was 2 months old. He grew to love it more and more. So don't give up and give it to someone else if your puppy is not crazy about them from the first day."
149,B0026RQTGE,5,Cheapest anywhere,My dog loves em. This is cheapest you will find these anywhere! This is my second time ordering great deal!
150,B0026RQTGE,4,Dog goes crazy for these,Keeps the dog's teeth nice and white. Smells like it is filled with minerals and all kinds of good stuff. Highly recommended by vets. Works well for us.
151,B0026RQTGE,5,=D,"This product is great, you get as many treats with the teenies as the Petite size and my puppies love them like crazy. The price is great, delivery service was great, overall happy with everything"
152,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,Shipped very fast.  Great product for your dog's teeth.  I have been giving my poodle greenies ofr years now and my vet said that her teeth are just as white and healthy as a 2 year old dogs.  She is 10 years old.
153,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies,"I buy Greenies frequently for my dogs. They love them. I buy them for my ""granddogs' also. Very good product."
154,B0026RQTGE,3,Container problem,"I have used these little treats for our 2 dogs for a while and never had a problem.  This time the container arrived a little dented and when I opened it, discovered that the inside pouch had been damaged and the greenies are stuck together.  Disappointing."
155,B0026RQTGE,4,My dog  loves these.,"My dog is not wild about many treats but she loves Greenies.  She just can't resist them.  She never eats the cat's food, but once I had some cat Greenies in the bowl and she scarffed them up!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that I wish they weren't so expensive."
156,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Deal!!,"Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that."
157,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for a good price,"Well, they are Greenies.  Not much else to say about them besides it's a fantastic price.  They come in the green box shown, but inside is a re-sealable bag to keep them fresh which was really nice and actually a concern I had when I first purchased them."
158,B0026RQTGE,5,buy in bulk!,"My dogs love these greenies. Their teeth are super white from chewing on them and their breath somehow is no longer as stinky. The only thing is that they are a tad-overpriced, so I recommend buying them in bulk if you are truly satisfied with this product like I am."
159,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are awesome!!,"My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the ""risk"" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!"
160,B0026RQTGE,4,Good value and dogs like them!,"These do help to keep my dogs teeth clean and they are just the right size for my 7 lb chihuahua. Much, much better value on Amazon then your local pet supply warehouse."
161,B0026RQTGE,5,best treat,"My dogs love these treats! When my dogs wake up in the morning thats the first thing they want to eat! Especially my dog Luna cries for one. When I say greenie, she immediately runs downstairs and sit right in front of the pantry for one. I highly recommend these treats!"
162,B0026RQTGE,5,love them and will buy again!,"I have a 10 month old puppy. She is a mix between 1/4 poodle, chihuahua, terrier, and maltese. She is SUPER picky with treats and food in general and she absolutely loves these!! She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long! She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny."
163,B0026RQTGE,4,My pups love it!,"I have two dogs and they both love this it. I've been giving them this treat for over a year now and had no issues. The only reason why I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not help my dogs with their minor tartar build up like it's supposed to. Other than that, it's a great treat."
164,B0026RQTGE,5,My Yorkies love these dental chews!,I give these little dental toothbrush treats to my three Yorkies and they scatter to all corners to protect and eat their treats. Small dogs often have dental problems and I use these to help their teeth!  They are the perfect size for my dogs.
165,B0026RQTGE,5,Yum (or so it seems),"I don't know what it is about them, but dogs will listen to you if you're offering one of these as a reward. My dog gets one every night, after she performs a few tricks flawlessly knowling the reward is one of these."
166,B0026RQTGE,5,perfect,Our 13 year old minature fox terrier loves them and they take a nice amount of time for her to devour.
167,B0026RQTGE,5,My Shiba Inu loves this as a favorite bedtime treat,Good for dogs with sensitive stomachs and tasty too!  Also very healthy / great guaranteed analysis.  Am already on my second box of 96 Teeny's!
168,B0026RQTGE,5,GREAT,LOVE the Greenies.....my rat terriers favorite snack!  Just say the word and they come running!  Enjoy them and don't forget to buy more!!
169,B0026RQTGE,5,love grenies,"As usual it's great, I get a lot of compliment about my black lab very white teeth ! I just wish they would make bigger boxes, the large greenies come only at a maximum of 17 a box."
170,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"The shipment came on time and was packed perfectly.  My dogs get two greenies daily, their teeth have less plaque and their breaths are pleasant  I love this product!"
171,B0026RQTGE,5,My Papillon and Bischon Love These!,"I got these for the ""health"" benefits of fresh breath, plaque and overall quality of stuff. I like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to identifying these treats as ""greenies""! Yes I know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now, its crazy. So I'd say, get these for your kids they will love them so much you'll have a hard time denying them at least one a day. I know I do."
172,B0026RQTGE,5,Squeaky clean!!,"I have a one year old Pomeranian whom has been on greenies since she was about 3mos. Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy ""smile"" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container."
173,B0026RQTGE,5,"Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews",Excellent healthy product for your small dogs!  Please be aware that you must watch your pup when giving them this small greenie or they will swallow the entire thing in one gulp!!  Quick Service by the Seller and Excellent Price for this product!  I will purchase more for sure!!
174,B0026RQTGE,5,Helps a lot!,"These were sold on here for much cheaper than I could find in stores, and I am very happy with how they helped my dog's breath. These are small, probably good for dogs 10 lbs or less."
175,B0026RQTGE,5,Awesome,My dog Lexie loves these things she gets one everynight at 7 and she let's us know if we are late with it
176,B0026RQTGE,5,love those greenies,I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.
177,B0026RQTGE,5,Great greenies,My dog loves these treats and the 96 count box is the best deal. They come in a foil package in the box so they stay fresh till the last one.
178,B0026RQTGE,3,Dog Teeth Cleaner,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase Greenies for my two dogs.  Unfortunately, neither one will eat them.  I gave one box to my son and one to my daughter and thier dogs love them.  Go figure."
179,B0026RQTGE,5,Love At First Bite!,"One of these at night, is my Yorkie's toothbrush & breath mint. He is almost ten, and loves his Greenies."
180,B0026RQTGE,5,Great,"My dog and I both love this product.  My vet even said it was great that my dog is having one every day.  I feed my dog homemade dog food which includes sardines, so Greenies are a necessity.<br />Don't know what we would do without them."
181,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great product, great price!",My two dogs adore Greenies!  This seemed to be the best place & price I found online.  Very quickly shipped too.
182,B0026RQTGE,5,Great dental chew deal,I purchased some Greenies Regular pack of 27 which I think is a great deal and it was delivered promptly.  But there is extra packaging which needs to be recycled.
183,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these!,My dog's morning just wouldn't be complete without her Greenie! I think it's the minty scent that drives her crazy but she loves them. She's @18 lb so the Teenies are just right for her.
184,B0026RQTGE,5,Doggie Must,"It's reassuring that the treats I give my precious Yorkie are of the best quality and of course I appreciate the cost effectiveness of dealing with a reputable company.  Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box, and she knows it's nap time or time for a treat."
185,B0026RQTGE,5,LOVE the large discount!,It's so wonderful not to have to pay the high prices at PetSmart for these Greenies.  My pups LOVE them!!
186,B0026RQTGE,5,TEENIE GREENIES,"THESE ARE THE BEST DENTAL TREATS ON THE MARKET!  MY CHIWEENIE THINKS THESE ARE THE BEST INVENTION SINCE MEAT.  LOL.  HER DAY IS NOT STARTED UNTIL SHE HAS ONE, THEN SHE EATS, BUT NEVER EATS FIRST!"
187,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love these.,My two dogs (Pugs) absolutely love these.  They get one every night and they have excellent dental health.  Amazon has the absolute best price over retail.
188,B0026RQTGE,5,Keep on Munching,"My puppy loves this product.  The moment he has a Greenie in his mouth, he'll begin to munch.  I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.  The product is just hard enough so that my puppy can keep gnawing on it, but it is simultaneously soft enough for him to sink his teeth into (providing assistance for teeth development).  I definitely recommend this product."
189,B0026RQTGE,5,Very Effective,"My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here."
190,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Dental Chews,My doggie loves Greenies she will not go to bed without her Greenie. They are digestible helps clean teeth. They are a bit expensive but they are a good product and I would and do recommend them.
191,B0026RQTGE,5,Teenie Greenies,These are the only treats I can get my dog to eat. She has to be limited as she will make a meal on these if I would let her.
192,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies dental chews,"Greenies dental chews are a product that my dogs love to eat.  Around 6:30-7:00 my dogs start to bark, jump up, follow me everywhere because it's time for their Greenies.  Best thing I ever got for them."
193,B0026RQTGE,5,Great for older dogs.,"I have an 11 year old Jack Russle who's teeth have worn down over the years. Greenies are great for him as they are not hard for him to chew and he LOVES them. Every evening all I have to say is ""Want your Greenie""? And he comes running. It's the only dog treat he eats now."
194,B0026RQTGE,5,Fantastic!,"My corgi loves these greenies!  I like it how the greenies come in a zippable bag inside the cardboard box!  I have the choice of throwing out the bag and using the box or vice versa!<br /><br />I chose the free shipping method.  It took awhile to ship, but once shipped, it came in a timely manner."
195,B0026RQTGE,4,Great Product,"My pug loves his ""Toothbrushes.""  THey help keep away dog breath, and I don't see a lot of plaque build up on his teeth."
196,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these.,"My dog thinks these are wonderful.<br />I think Amazon's price for them is wonderful.<br />It's not difficult to find other dog owners who would be willing to split a box, so I'm not worried about brittleness.<br />Win-Win"
197,B0026RQTGE,5,OMG look at the great price!!!!,my yorkies love these things. I have a 3 pounder and an 11 pounder and they think getting these are the bees knees! i tried the other sizes but i think since these just fit right in their mouth they love it. The product has a really over bearing smell but once you get over that (it is a dog treat) its amazing
198,B0026RQTGE,5,What a bargain!,I am so happy with the deal I got on these Greenies.  My dogs are even happier.  House full of happy campers with these here.
199,B0026RQTGE,5,Great price..,Came with the plastic bin! My Lhasa Apso liked at first but tired of it a couple weeks later. Bummer. So I gave away. She prefers natural chicken jerky now..
200,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog goes crazy over these!,My dog has been loving these chews for years! I give him one everyday and it has done a great job at keeping plaque and tartar build up at bay.
201,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these!,"My dog is in love with these treats. He comes running when I say, ""Do you want a greeny?"" Then he takes it under the bed to devour it. My dog's teeth and breath stay healthy due to his greenies in between brushings. Nice to get such a big box at this great price."
202,B0026RQTGE,5,Crack for my dog,My dog loooves these treats. He's a 50 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback mutt and devours these! I'm not sure about the dental impact yet as he's only had them for 2 weeks or so. But this combined with toothpaste would be more effective.
203,B0026RQTGE,5,Puppy love,I have a pitbull who loves her treats I'm obsessed with keeping her healthy so these work great on her teeth and they're a great price!
204,B0026RQTGE,5,best dental chew,"I was kinda skeptic about this green chews. Turned out my dogs love it very much.<br />Had purchased my 5th boxes, and worked well on preventing teeth decay. Very satisfied and will keep restock."
205,B0026RQTGE,4,Greenie Good,Our labradoodle likes his Greenies.  The product seems to be helping with the plaque problem he's been having.  It is a bit costly for continual use.
206,B0026RQTGE,4,Good price,"Bob loves these treats better than anything and lets me know every day when it's Greenie Time.  I cut them in half because they are so expensive but I've been able to find them at much better prices on Amazon than in the pet food stores even with the manufacturer's infrequent coupon.  If your dog loves these, buy them online and save."
207,B0026RQTGE,5,yummy for my dog,"My dog loves these treats.  I can comb her or cut the wads of hair under her ears when she is eating one of these.  Otherwise forget it.  She is still young, so I hope I will get her to sit still while I groom her, but for now my puppy and I love these.  The shipper was great too."
208,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies from Amazon,"The price is rite!!! this is the second time I bought them, dogs love them!!! will bye some more!!! thats about it."
209,B0026RQTGE,5,Great taste & great value,"My dogs love the Greenies taste. They prefer Greenies to any of their other treats. They've been chewing Greenies for 5 yrs, and have not had to have their teeth cleaned."
210,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Price!,I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.
211,B0026RQTGE,5,A teethsaver!,"About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!"
212,B0026RQTGE,4,"Our dog loves them, but eats them FAST!","We bought these for our 65 lb golden retriever. He is not a powerful chewer since he has a retriever's mouth, but he is a diligent chewer. He'll chew and keep chewing once he gets going. The size of the large-sized Greenies seems right for him.<br /><br />Our dog's breath was getting stinky and we were noticing some buildup of plaque, so we got the Greenies Dental Treats. He simply loves these. But he eats them a little to fast. They only last a few minutes. I wish he would chew more and swallow less!<br /><br />But our dogs breath does seem better. We don't use them every day, more like every other day to make them last, but they still seem to do some decent teeth cleaning. I would use these in combination with other teeth/gum health products like the Nylabones and raw hides."
213,B0026RQTGE,5,So Happy to find this vendor!!!,"This is a fantastic deal!! My dogs love greenies but at over $20 per bag at the local pet supply store, I couldn't afford to give them one everyday. I order these again and again."
214,B0026RQTGE,5,Treats,Our little guy eats one of these a day after dinner.  he sits and waits until they are given. A super price for the box and fast shipping. Will definately order again.
215,B0026RQTGE,5,Great treats,"Any edible bone can cause a dog to choke, but Greenies changed their formula about a year ago to make it more digestible.  I love the product."
216,B0026RQTGE,5,"Sticky, but delicious.","My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."
217,B0026RQTGE,5,Maggie's Favorite,"We have tried other chew products for our dog and these are by far her favorite. They don't get messy like other chew treats and her breath smells so much better, even better than the dental milkbones out there. She really does prefer these over any other dog treat."
218,B0026RQTGE,3,Great product but poor advertising on Amazon's part,"Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!"
219,B0026RQTGE,5,Great for older dogs,My son brought these home one day for our 12 year old Cocker Spaniel. She became 'hooked' on them rather quickly and starts howling for them around 7:00pm daily. Amazon pricing is significantly less than the local stores and Prime delivery is incredibly convenient.
220,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves them,"We bought these as a Christmas present for my dog, and he just loves them!  A little pricey, but he's worth it."
221,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are great....albiet Xpensive,"All greenies are overpriced.  But, since my critters love 'em so, I watch the price and get a bunch when it drops to a more reasonable level.  Still too high, but.....<br /><br />Since I'm buying something, I think is way overpriced...  yet I still buy it, should say it all.  My gang loves the darn things.  I prefer tendons or pizzles, since they last awhile.  But, they love Greenies.  So, I get em.<br /><br />You probably will too...  we got our pets, right where THEY want us......"
222,B0026RQTGE,4,For sparkling doggy teeth,"Of all the dog teeth treats, I bought this one because it was highly recommended by doggie dentists. If your dog doesn't take to it right away, have some patience. My own dog took it in strides at first--she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her breath (which is never very minty fresh), but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way."
223,B0026RQTGE,5,These are great!!!,"Our dogs have only been chewing these for about a week and a half and they are great for freshening their breath!!! Their breath was so bad that you couldn't stand having them breathe anywhere by you, now their breath is alot better. I think that it is only gonna continue to get better :) Plus they love them and these don't upset their sensitive tummies!!!! I would recommend these to anyone :)"
224,B0026RQTGE,5,Woof,"""I love them""<br /><br />  - Winston the dog<br /><br />""These are delicious""<br /><br />  - Suzi the dog<br /><br />""feh....not a reasonable substitute for tunafish""<br /><br />  - Peke the cat"
225,B0026RQTGE,4,Greenies are the Greatest,"I've been giving my dogs Greenies for years now.  Their excitement at receiving this treat never abates.  As expensive as they are, I feel my animals are well worth it.  This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However, I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people - put the product in a pouch and call it a day."
226,B0026RQTGE,5,my dogs go crazy for Greenies,My chihuahua and pomeranian get so excited when I bring out the teenie dental chews after their meal--I hope these are always in stock as I buy them frequently. It does seems to help reduce the tartar on their teeth and it's exceptionally high in protein unlike other treats.
227,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Help for Bad Breath!!,"I tried these on the recommendation of our veterinarian for my 2 little dogs' bad breath. I didn't think they would like them, since the treat is hard & they favor soft treats. But both dogs love them! Within 2 days, their breath was improving. Now, they get their once a day treat to keep their breath smelling fresh."
228,B0026RQTGE,5,"Oh, if we could afford to buy these all the time...","Our pups go nutty when we break out the Greenies.  They can hardly perform their requested tasks for the treats because they're just too excited.  They're a bit expensive for our budget right now, but when we can afford it, we really like to get these for them.  Keeps their breath very clean-smelling and they really just... love love love their Greenies!"
229,B0026RQTGE,5,My poodle loves greenies!,My poodle loves greenies!  We joke that they're like crack to her.  She demands one every night at 8 pm.  I can't complain too much though - her breath is great!
230,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Chews,This is the third  ontainer we have purchased and as a once a day treat the dogs love them. All have learned to sit and beg after each morning outing.  Try them for your dog!  Good value for your money as I use the 96 pack.
231,B0026RQTGE,4,Work great!,"My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much."
232,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog gone good,"You won't be able to over sleep if your dog gets hooked on these dental chews.  One is enough, but your dog will drive you crazy until you get up and offer him this special way to start his day."
233,B0026RQTGE,5,Great treat to keep teeth healthy,One greenie a day after dinner helps our dog's teeth stay cleaner.  Also we brush daily with the salmon oil infused grain alcohol gel product.  That works so much better than the enzymatic toothpastes.
234,B0026RQTGE,5,My puppies love them and it helps keep their teeth clean!,"Got these large Greenies originally when we noticed our 60+lb Boxer mix puppies' teeth were getting a little dirty and brushing didn't too much.  We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work, they love them.  The boy gobbles it down, but his sister savors every bit.  They also keep the buildup on their teeth down quite a bit, they're not going to make them shine, but they'll keep them pretty clean!"
235,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for dogs,"Molly and Cocoa, our cocker spaniels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in ""lite"" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.  I would highly recommend greenies for a great treat that helps clean dog's teeth and eliminate bad breath."
236,B0026RQTGE,4,Save yourself a few bucks,If your dogs go thru the shakes when you run out like mine do then you need to stock up. The cheapest price you will find delivered to your home. Better deal than you will ever get in a store.
237,B0026RQTGE,4,My Picky Dogs Love Them,"I have 2 fairly large dogs that need chew treats to help clean their teeth, but they are very picky and reject most of this type of treats.  They love these, though, and by purchasing the Tub Pack, I save a lot in comparison to the other possibilities."
238,B0026RQTGE,4,Small dog loves these.  They don't last long.,"I have a 12 pound, 18 month old couton.  He would rate these as 5 stars.<br /><br />The problem is, he finishes these off in 5 minutes.<br /><br />This makes it an expensive dog biscuit, rather than a dental chew toy."
239,B0026RQTGE,5,Loves clean teeth!,"My dog seems to know when it about noon and time to ""brush his teeth!"" He does vertical jumps until that little green toothbrush comes out of the container!"
240,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Lite Treat Tub-Pak 27- ounce,"Greenies lite treats tub pak is the way to go for my dog, she always looks forward to one of these before she goes to bed."
241,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dogs Go Crazy for These Greenies,I buy the lite teenies for my two little dogs and they are just right for treats.  My dogs will do anything to get these.
242,B0026RQTGE,5,Happy!,"My dog loves Greenies! Read some reviews about it online and tried it out since Amazon Prime shipping is free, the price was affordable, and my dog refuses to have his teeth brushed. I've been giving him 1 per day for a few days now and it's like a treat to him! I'm satisfied. :-)"
243,B0026RQTGE,5,Saw a difference very quickly...and my dog loves them,"I have an Old English Sheepdog puppy who was developing inflamed gums and awful dog breath way younger than he should have been.  I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.  Next box, I'm going to buy an even smaller size so I can divide the treat up even more throughout the day."
244,B0026RQTGE,4,Doggies Addicted!,"I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.  These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm.  I personally thoroughly check for anything foreign which is due to the manufacturer and not Amazon."
245,B0026RQTGE,5,Turned her teeth around,"When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually brown.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better. Although they are not inexpensive, I think they do a good job.  And she also enjoys them very much.  I have checked many places and have found Amazons prices to be the best so far."
246,B0026RQTGE,5,great product- great seller!,This item came from the shipper quick and as described.  my dog LOVES greenies- and they really do seem to keep his teeth and breath clean.
247,B0026RQTGE,4,"Dogs devour them, does it clean their teeth?","I have two dogs, 22 pounds and 45 pounds. Got the large size which is supposed to be for 50-100 lbs. My dogs love these things. I mean within a few short minutes they are gone. I thought they would be a little more of a challenge. I guess the big question is are they in my dogs mouth long enough to actually do any teeth cleaning? Or are they just a delicious treat for my dogs to enjoy?"
248,B0026RQTGE,5,Our dog loves Greenies,"Our old dog has dental problems and arthritis.  She LOVES her Greenies and reminds us that she ""deserves"" one a day.  Since starting on her ""senior"" Greenies, she is much more limber and agile.  She has also started chewing on her chew sticks again (after several years of not being interested in them...and yes, we take her to the vet to have her teeth cleaned)."
249,B0026RQTGE,4,Dog Preference,Our Cocker Spaniel is spoiled on all kinds of treats including table leftovers but she always has room for a Greenie.  Her dental hygene is also important to us and the Greenies seem to do the job.
250,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"Greenies were at a super price!!! Great packaging, prompt delivery. Our dogs love them. Great doing business with this site. Will look here next time I want to order this item!!!"
251,B0026RQTGE,5,"The only way to go, unless money is not an issue!","Our three dogs love Greenies. They are very expensive (usually $32.99, but marked down to $29.99 sometimes). Then, on top of that you have state tax. So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has ""Pet"" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!<br />The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat. With the smaller sizes the dogs still get a treat and the boxes have a lot larger amount of Greenies in them."
252,B0026RQTGE,5,Best price ever!,What a price for a product I always buy for my dog. Thanks so much Amazon! I will be back to buy more Greenies!
253,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them and have clean breathe,"No complaints. My dogs both enjoy them and they have nice breathe afterwards. My dogs are 10 pounds each and I got the Teenies. They are very chewy so it takes a bit for my dogs to eat them, but I think that is part of the fun for them. Highly recommend!"
254,B0026RQTGE,5,Lucy and Moe love them,These are great treats for dogs. My bichon is 14 pounds but this is a good size treat for her and the fact that they promote dental health is a bonus.
255,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for my dog,"I have used them for years.  My dog can't wait to get one each morning. She does a ""Greenie Dance"".  She jumps around and wiil do about anything to get the Greenie.  This was the first time I ordered them on amazon and I'm glad I did.  I got the lowest price ever and they were delivered the fastest."
256,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs LOVE these!,"All dogs love these treats/chews! It does keep both of my dogs' teeth cleaned and they love it! They know that when I get home from work every night, they get a treat and they are so excited. I highly recommend these :) Plus they are much cheaper on Amazon.com, than at your local Petsmart or PetCo."
257,B0026RQTGE,4,Our dogs' favorite!,"When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed."
258,B0026RQTGE,5,Amazing!,While they are expensive Greenies do the trick for a dogs dental health. We tried a couple other brands and went back to these. The price on Amazon cant be beat. Dog is happy as well and gets excited whenever anyone says Greenie! His breath is so much better after just a day or two of use.
259,B0026RQTGE,5,"Teenie ""Lite"" Greenies","we brush our dogs teeth in the morning and feed once a day at evening time so we give him a Greenie after he eats to clean up his teeth and breath because we give him Sardine oil with his meal and this works great ""no fish breath"".  He loves the Greenies."
260,B0026RQTGE,5,I Want my GREENIE! Arf Arf!!!!,"When my toy poodle finishes her dog food-she comes to me and barks and barks for her treat, GREENIES.She will not stop barking till she gets it.  I make sure she has eaten her dog food then she gets her GREENIE. It is the highlight of her day,and she is the happiest dog. Her teeth are very white and she has the sweetest smelling breath.I make sure I am never out of GREENIES.The price is the greatest too.Thank you.D>D>"
261,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dog Likes Them!,"Got the teenie greenies for my 16 1/2lb Shih Tzu- Lhasa Apso.  The package says that these are for dogs that range 5-15lbs, but I ordered them anyway (trying to save some money).  She loves them.  Gobbles them up straight away.<br /><br />Only advice-Stick to the poundage recommendation.  These treats are so small that I doubt my dog is getting the benefits of tartar control/removal.  On the bright side, she likes the taste, so they certainly work as regular daily treats."
262,B0026RQTGE,5,Best Value!,"My dog loves these things, and I love that you can get almost 100 for about $20, if you went to a pet store you'd be paying at least twice as much for these things.  I have a Yorkie, and I only give these to her every so often (I try to remember to give one every other day so she doesn't get fatter).  I really hope that Amazon keeps them this cheap and I'll keep buying them"
263,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are Great !,"[[ASIN:B000KBFKIQ Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Petite Pack, 45 Chews<br /> are not only great for Dogs teeth ~ but they must taste great.. I have a great dog who knows exactly when it is 5:00PM and has a particular bark for her Greenie. She is spoiled, so she also knows when it is 7:30PM and time for her second treat and barks that same bark for her second one.<br /><br />The vet did say that her teeth look great !!"
264,B0026RQTGE,5,MY CHIHUAHUAS LOVE THEM!,"These bones are great!  Each one of my 22 chihuahuas love these bones.  I'm hoping they will help with their breath but even if they don't, it's still a great product for my chi's since they enjoy them so much."
265,B0026RQTGE,5,Our Doggy's All Time Favorite Treat,"We have 4 very spoiled furbabies & Greenies are their ""special"" treat.  They each get a greenie when they are groomed, brushed, bathed, etc.  Just say the word Greenie & you have a flash mob of doggies begging energeticly at your feet."
266,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Rock!,"My little dog loves Greenies chews! We were first introduced to this dental treat at our vet's office and seeing how much Toby loved them I decided to start buying them for him. Imagine how surprised I was finding out the price at the pet store! When I saw this fabulous deal on Amazon for 96 Greenies I was thrilled. This will be Toby's favorite present under the tree for certain. As always, great fast service and even greater buys through Amazon."
267,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs gone wild!,"I have no idea what is in these but my wire hair terrier goes wild when the box comes out.  My daughter started me on these and he just loves them.  Had to get the small chew so he does not get fat on them as they are loaded with calories.  Checked with my vet and they had no problem with them, use for own dogs.  Only problem is once you start your dog on these it will be a continuous treat and even from Amazon these are not cheap.  As quickly as they are devoured the per minute price is astronomical.  But it is hard to deprive a dog you love of such a tasty treat!"
268,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these dental chews.,My dog loves these dental chews and they work well to keep most of the plaque off her teeth.  That saves on the vet bill.
269,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love these,It is hard to find Greenies at a good price. This was the best price that i have found recently. My dog loves Greenies.
270,B0026RQTGE,5,the best!,I bought this product because I had a coupon it was a little expensive but I give one a week to my dog.  My dog loves them and if she could speak she would say please give me one a day.
271,B0026RQTGE,5,Do these things work,We started giving these to our dog to avoid having to have her teeth cleaned at a cost of 4 times human cleaning.  We'll see if it worked on our next vet appointment.
272,B0026RQTGE,5,Two Paws way Up,My dog loves these treats and they help with her aging dog breath.  These arrived fast and fresh. Two Paws Up!
273,B0026RQTGE,5,TASTY TREATS,MY DOG LOVES THEM. SHE GETS THEM EVERY MORNING AFTER SHE GOES OUT. SHE WON'T SETTLE DOWN UNTIL AFTER SHE HAS ONE. SHE WON'T LET ME FORGET ABOUT THEM. SHE LOOKS FOWARD TO IT EVERY DAY.
274,B0026RQTGE,5,Great,This is a great deal. So much cheaper than the pet store. My dog loves these and it helps her breath smell better. It used to be terrible but she has gotten better after eating these. I just wish they lasted longer for her as she can chew one up in about 2 minutes.
275,B0026RQTGE,4,Not a huge fan of the ingrediants but my dog loves them,"My 11 year old dog loves greenies!  It's the best treat besides the smoked salmon he regularly gets.  The smell weird and the ingrediants are not that clean, but he's a fairly picky dog."
276,B0026RQTGE,4,Tasty treats,"My dog is relatively picky when it comes to treats, but she loves these. They don't do much to help her doggy breath, but maybe over time they will help."
277,B0026RQTGE,5,Healthy treat my dog loves,"My dog is about 70lbs, 11 years old and diabetic. We couldn't completely cut her off from all treats once she became diabetic, so we needed something healthier. She loves Greenies and they're healthy enough for us to feel comfortable. Yeah, they are pricey but if you buy them on Amazon with the free shipping they are alot cheaper than buying them in stores! For all she gives us, the treats are still a bargain!"
278,B0026RQTGE,5,Love them!,"or really my dog loves them.  When I have a busy day and I am too tired to brush her teeth, I just give her one of these instead and they do as they describe:  keep her teeth clean.  They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them."
279,B0026RQTGE,5,Too Good!,"Our dog, Wylie, begs for a Greenie first thing in the AM. He would eat them exclusively if we allowed it (only one a day is allowed)! Teeth look great, so far."
280,B0026RQTGE,5,DOG LOVES THEM!,MY DOG LOVES GREENIES!  THIS IS A GREAT PRICE!  BETTER PRICE THAN ALL THE PET STORES.  WILL REORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN.
281,B0026RQTGE,5,Doggie Dope,My chihuahuas love their greenies.  If they don't get them by 6:30 p.m. they let me know.  It's part of their routine and they know it.
282,B0026RQTGE,5,Teenie Weenie,My dog loves this treat. It helps clean his teeth daily since brushing is not an option because he dislikes it. I recommend watching your dog while he chews it to prevent choking!!!!!
283,B0026RQTGE,5,They're Greenies,"I don't know if they actually freshen Sugar's breath or not, but she really likes them!  And since she's the princess, she can have whatever she wants!"
284,B0026RQTGE,5,Fantastic price & Charlie loves them,"Great bargain , Amazons price is at least $10 cheaper the petco & petsmart .Our Jack Russell loves his nightly greenie.  I know we should be brushing his teeth but he turns into a Tasmanian devil every time we try. I like to think the greenies are the reason for his white teeth + he doesn't have doggie breath."
285,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Price and Product,I have ordered Greenie's several times from this buyer and I am always pleased with the quality as well as the price. This large box costs almost $1 each at Petco and PetSmart.
286,B0026RQTGE,5,Good for your pet,Greenies are great. I have 3 dogs who really love and 2 of them<br />the 2 yr old and the 4 yr old have beautiful clean teeth. I only<br />wish I had known about them when the 12 yr old was young.  They really<br />love them and its improves their breath
287,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies review,"I bought 5 boxes of greenies, 2 for my dog and 3 for my friend's dog and the dogs go crazy about greenies!"
288,B0026RQTGE,5,Great,Our dog loves them.  He is 35 lbs and the Regular size is perfect and it seems to help with his teeth.
289,B0026RQTGE,5,Great doggie treats!,My dogs love these treats. I have 3 small dogs and they can't wait to get their morning dental treat. The younger dogs teeth are pretty white and I hope to keep them this way but my older dogs teeth have some tartar on them. I noticed the tartar has gone down quite a bit after a month of feeding him these treats. Hope his teeth keep getting better.
290,B0026RQTGE,5,Excellent,"My bog loves these dental chews more than any other treat I have ever given him.  As a bonus they seem to give my dog better smelling breath.  Just so that it doesn't take you by surprise, they will turn your dog's poop a darker shade because of the coloring.<br /><br />I highly recommend these."
291,B0026RQTGE,5,My Chihuahua loves these!,I haven't been using them long enough to see if they are keeping his teeth clean. I am optimistic though. Once he has finished all 96 I should be able to tell.<br />He gets one a day and really loves them.
292,B0026RQTGE,4,Well...,My dog's bad breath went away...but as for long term health effects I have no idea whether positive or negative. My dog likes them and they've been recommended to me by everyone around. Amazon tends to beat the box xstores by 5-7$ a box.
293,B0026RQTGE,4,greenies teenie for clean dog teeth,my italian greyhounds loves these greenies for their teeth and have used them for several years as they are very prone to cavities. They are 8 years old now
294,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these,"I've been giving these dental chews to my chihuahua mix daily when I leave for work in the morning. She absolutely loves them and looks forward to them. Before I started giving these to her, she would cry when I was leaving, but now she actually gets excited. They don't last too long, but they last long enough for me to leave without her noticing. And these big boxes last for months."
295,B0026RQTGE,5,My doggies love these,"These are the best doggie treats ever. My little dachshunds go crazy for these. If I forget to give them their morning greenies, they come looking for me in the house and leap in the air and whine until I get up and go to the cabinet and fetch them a greenie. They do a good job keeping their breath clean too."
296,B0026RQTGE,5,Love Greenies!,"I have been feeding Greenies to my 9 year old Schipperke since she was old enough to eat them.  She loves them, her teeth are exceptionally clean which I attribute to having fed these to her all of these years.  My Boy Schipperke is now 6 and I have feed them to him also.  My Vet remarks every time I take them for appointments how clean their teeth are.  I also brush their teeth most nights so a combined effort and my dogs teeth have never needed to be cleaned which has saved their little bodies from the trauma of anesthesia. Feed the right size and ALWAYS watch your animal with any treat."
297,B0026RQTGE,5,They are the best...,"Been using Greenies for a couple months.  I have a toy poodle with a sensitive stomach.  So far, no issue for her.<br /><br />And it is sooo nice, no more doggie breath for her.  I highly recommend the treat as long as your dog can tolerate.  Seems like it has helped with the tartar too which is what motivated me for the purchase.<br /><br />Thanks Greenies!!! :-)"
298,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog dental chews,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KEVF32"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Regular, Pack of 27</a> A great product at a great price. My dogs love them."
299,B0026RQTGE,4,Dogs love these bones and I can see a difference,These really whiten their teeth.<br />And the dogs love them.  Works great for my big dog.<br />The price is why they only get 4 stars.
300,B0026RQTGE,2,Dog goes crazy for these,"EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either."
301,B0026RQTGE,5,Great price - my dog loves these things!,"I shopped a little to find the best price for these treats for my dog. This was the best I found, and with free shipping, it was even better than going to the petstores in my neighborhood!"
302,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for large dogs,After doing an extensive price comparison we ended up purchasing a double pack from Amazon. So pleased with the Greenies product! Took one of our dogs for his annual exam yesterday and the doctor mentioned TWICE how good our boy's teeth look! YAY!
303,B0026RQTGE,5,wonderful Greenies,"A friends told me how much her dogs love Greenies. I was skeptical, a dog loves Any treat but i decided to buy some to give my dogs and I am sold, they just LOVE Greenies even my little picky boy who is very choosy, soon as he sees the Greenies box he runs to get his share. from now on they will get a Greenies everyday for a treat."
304,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Dental Chews,Greenies (96) were received quickly in a protective box. They were fresh in a resealable bag. I would order from vendor again.
305,B0026RQTGE,5,Best Price Available ANYWHERE!!!,I have been buying Greenies for years - this company had the best price - very satisfied!!<br />Shipment arrived faster than promised and packaging was original from manufactuer.
306,B0026RQTGE,4,Greenies,"I've bought these greenies twice now from Amazon.  Amazon has one of the best prices on the Internet, but I still feel the product is way too expensive.  I'm now using a cheaper product from Walmart that is supposed to do the same thing so far as cleaning teeth."
307,B0026RQTGE,5,tonytada,very cheap compared to buying in the stores. great price for this product. product was fresh not stale. i don't know why they insist on making you put 20 words down for just saying the product is low cost and good.
308,B0026RQTGE,5,Vet says she's got really clean teeth,"We give Greenies (""Teenie"" size) to our 12-year old miniature poodle. Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her breath is nicer, too, since we started giving her Greenies.<br /><br />We give her one every day or so and she will carry it around 'protecting' it for an hour or so before settling down and devouring it. We tried other brands but she will only accept the best. She is terrified of thunderstorms and will come out from under the bed only if we offer her her favorite treat: a Greenie."
309,B0026RQTGE,5,Great price on a great chew,"We give our dog one of these per day to help clean her teeth.  I don't really know how well they work, but she loves them, and so we're happy to give them to her.  Amazon has absolutely the best price on these - I've looked extensively.  When we call ""greenie"" she comes running, and takes it to her special ""greenie chair"" to enjoy!"
310,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"I always buy greenies for my two dogs.  They each get one at night for dessert.  I try to get the best price and know that if I go through amazon.com, I will be able to see what the best value is."
311,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies dog chews,"This is a great product, the puppies just love them and they are great for their teeth and breath at a good price."
312,B0026RQTGE,5,Lily's favorite,"My dog, Lily, loves these dental chews...they are her favorite treat! It's the<br />one treat she looks most forward to every day."
313,B0026RQTGE,5,No stomach issues,Both my dogs love these treats.  They trouble with rawhides and chicken strips but have had not trouble with these.
314,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,My dog absolutely loves the greenies...he gets one at night and he thinks its a great treat!! Decent price for treats...
315,B0026RQTGE,5,Very good,My toy poodle loves the Greenies. I give him one every day. Along with brushing I feel the greenies are helping to keep his teeth clean.
316,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,My dogs look forward to this treat every morning. It helps the breath issue and satisfies the chewing need as well! I can't be without them.
317,B0026RQTGE,5,Perfect for our little doggies,"Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't? I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect! A great price for a great product. Who could ask for more."
318,B0026RQTGE,5,They're Greenies. What else do you need to know?,Greenies!  My dog loves 'em.<br /><br />I like buying them from Amazon since they're so much cheaper than the pet store.
319,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"You cant go wrong with greenies! My dogs love them and go nuts on them. Only downside to this is that its so soft it gets chewed up quickly so i dont quite see how this will improve the dogs teeth and gums.<br /><br />Amazon has the best prices by far and with no tax + amazon prime, this by far, becomes the cheapest place to buy products."
320,B0026RQTGE,5,Our dog loves Greenies,"Greenies are a healthy treat for dogs and they love them!  I first bought them while working at a hardware/feed store to give them a try. We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them, they come in all sizes for all dogs and really do keep their teeth in great condition."
321,B0026RQTGE,4,Dogs really like them,My dogs love these. They start drooling everytime they get these. Not really sure if they do anything for their teeth/breath. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars just because these are alittle pricey considering they are gone in like 30 seconds.
322,B0026RQTGE,5,Will order again,"Very quick delivery and same quality goods!  Cheaper than buying them at the actual pet store.  So, I'll be ordering again when I run out.  My dogs love them and their breath is a lot better."
323,B0026RQTGE,5,Great price on an item he's crazy about,"My 60 lb Ridgeback-mix is just crazy about these.  By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie-mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan, too, this is certainly a great price.  Shipping was reasonable, as well ... particularly when ordering several boxes ... and quick."
324,B0026RQTGE,1,Greenies Lite - Not for dogs who had the taste of regular Greenies,"My little dog who's rather picky about his treats absolutely loves Greenies REGULAR.  As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular."
325,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Dental Chews,"My postman started giving Maddie Greenies when she was about a year old, when he stopped I had to purchase them myself, she has one each day, she is now 13 1/2, she loves them I feel they are good for the gums and teeth, she has had very few pulled, looks good for a Senior.  I would highly recommend them to any one who has a pet."
326,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs favorite treat,"I've yet to meet a dog that wasn't absolutely nutty about Greenies, so being able to order them here at a comparatively economical price is wonderful. We keep them on hand; if we didn't our dogs would riot."
327,B0026RQTGE,5,"For now fine, will know more at next physical","My dog really enjoys these as a daily treat. However, until she has her next physical I really can't evaluate these properly. I will try to remember to update after her physical so I can report back if her tartar build-up has been reduced or eliminated. Our vet said they work IF your dog chews them slowly. Our dog goes through them pretty fast, so I am not sure if they are going to be effective. We decided to give them a year and see what happens."
328,B0026RQTGE,5,Love these for my old guy...,"Even though these are pricey, my old Aussie Shep loves them. I am glad there is a special senior formula. Thanks Greenies!"
329,B0026RQTGE,5,Great for Treats and Teeth,"These Greenies are a great buy. I used to get the Petite size for my Bicon/Poodle and my Bichon, but found that you get more treats with the Teenies and the dogs enjoy them just as much. So, if you have small dogs up to say 25 or 30 pounds, the Teenies are the best. I don't think you can find them any cheaper."
330,B0026RQTGE,5,dogs love greenies,Dogs love these things. they sit around the cupboard begging for more. These are a great training tool for a food motivated dog.
331,B0026RQTGE,4,Pooch loves them...breath and teeth are nice,My puppy loves them. She burns through them like nobody's business and they give her a softer stool but she really goes nuts for them. She has no tartar and nice breath though
332,B0026RQTGE,5,dogs love greenies,"My dogs love these things. They would eat the entire box at once if they could. Ask them who wants a greenie, and they run to the cupboard and bark."
333,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them,I purchased these for my dogs for thier teeth cleaning capabilities. My dogs love them and the price on Amazon was much better than in the stores. They do help with cleaning the tarter off of my dogs teeth
334,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"My dog loves these Greenies,  they are very addictive. They have become his all time favorite treat. They are a little expensive but helps keep his teeth clean and he enjoys them so much."
335,B0026RQTGE,5,Puppy loves the Greenies!,"This is a favorite treat of our 7 month old standard poodle puppy. He is an aggressive chewer, so we need something which will occupy him. The Greenie really seems to satisfy  - after chewing through it (which, admittedly, only takes a few minutes) he will lie down and stop bothering us during dinner.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive. Each Greenie costs about $1.50, so it pains me a little to see it evaporate so quickly. But that is a function of my dog, not the product."
336,B0026RQTGE,5,ambers greenies,Amber loves her greenies and they sure help to keep her teeth clean.I hope this continues and I can avoid another expensive(dentel bill)from her vet.
337,B0026RQTGE,4,Good value - good price,"This product is a good value, good price.  Greenies can be much more expensive in pet food store.  Item is delivered quickly and it is sealed.  They always seem to be fresh and consistent.  I feed my dog (1) day so I go through them quickly."
338,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great buy, my dogs are addicted to Greenies.","This is a great buy, I was paying over twice as much for a box of them. All three of my Poms love Greenies, and expect them every morning. :)"
339,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"My dog Sadie loves these bones!  They are her absolute favorite! Usually after I give her a different bone, she just likes to be chased around the bedroom, alot, but with these, one quick chase and she lays right down to chow on it. Once a week or longer is all I spoil her with these making them even more special."
340,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies From Amazon,The price is excellent and the product arrived in a timely manner.  I will always buy this product from Amazon.
341,B0026RQTGE,5,good value!,Good value for a lot of treats! my dog absolutely loves these and it's awesome that they sell them on amazon for half the price of what they would sell it for at a pet store! Will continue buying from here as long as they're available :)
342,B0026RQTGE,5,Crazy for Greenies,My dogs are crazy for Greenies.  I love that they come in so many sizes.  I have two dogs and the teenies are perfect for my little dog and the petite are great for my medium dog.
343,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dogs LOVE Greenies!,My three dogs love Greenies.  So much so that they know the exact time every evening they are supposed to get them! They act like kids in a candy store!
344,B0026RQTGE,4,Do seems to like them...,We bought these because of the dogs bad breath... he seems to like them. His breath is better and they have not caused him any problems.
345,B0026RQTGE,5,Our Dogs Know When it is Time for their Greenie,"Every evening, about the same time, our two dogs know when it is time for their Greenie treat. They will both come and sit in front of us and patiently wait for us to get their treat. If we are busy and ignore them they will give a soft cry to get our attention. Each one only gets one a day, but other than walks, petting and their dinner, the Greenie is a highlight of their day."
346,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs Love Greenies,"I have two Boston Terriers and a Terrier mix.<br />They wait in line for these every morning.<br />Their breath is much better.<br />They are a little pricey, but worth it."
347,B0026RQTGE,5,Ultra clean teeth,Awesome product for keeping my doggies teeth clean and tarter free. It must be used everyday to be effective. I would highly recommend it for any breed.
348,B0026RQTGE,5,"Fat free, good for oral hygene and the very favorite of my dog","Finding this product on Amazon was like finding an unexpected Christmas present!<br /><br />Highly recommend by the vet, because of price, I save it for special occasion (always once a day) and, by far, the treat my dog just loves.  True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers ""Greenie, greenie"" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.  A good testiment for a fantastic product!!"
349,B0026RQTGE,5,Our dog has fresh breath,"No doggie breath for our dog.  People are always commenting that she doesn't have bad breath and her teeth look so clean.  A friend of ours who runs a veterinary and rescue clinic recommended them to us when our dog was very little, and we've sworn by them ever since."
350,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves greenies and they are very well priced on Amazon!,My little loved one gets a greenie a day. He loves them. I shop around for the best price on everything I buy and Amazon had the lowest price!
351,B0026RQTGE,5,Excellent Teeth Cleaner,Greenies are very muched loved as a tatsy Treat by are two small dogs!!! At 96 Chews they last a long time!!!
352,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dogs Love Them,"I have 3 dogs and they each love Greenies and they know exactly where I hide them so when I am close to the treat door, they get all excited.  In addition my boys have the freshest breath at the dog park."
353,B0026RQTGE,5,3 Dackels joy,"Being the ""mom"" of three mini wirehair doxies I spend a lot of money on a number of things.  Imagine my surprise to find such a bargain of Greenies on Amazon.  I really must make a habit of first checking any purchases to see if available on Amazon.  Hang tough on the CA sales tax issue, I live in CA and I am taxed enough already."
354,B0026RQTGE,5,Ambers favorite,My girl (Amber) just loves her greenies.She knowes where I keep them and lets me know when she wants one.
355,B0026RQTGE,5,WAY cheaper than your local pet supply store!,Our vet recommended this for our dog. It was selling for $37.99 at our local pet supply store. Found it here for way less!
356,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies,my pug misty is 7 years old i have given her greenies seince she was 4 months old. i give her 1 a day as a treat. i give them on the second time she goes out side in the morning and she loves them more than anything else that she gets and she knows what time it is. her teeth have been cleaned once the vet said her teeth are perfect. i buy greenies from amazon beacause the service and the price is the best there is.  billy j.  alabama.
357,B0026RQTGE,5,Most competitive price around!,"One of my two male Shih-tzus absolutely LIVES for his Greenie which he knows he gets to have after our morning walk, so they are an item that I cannot run out of! I haven't tasted the myself, not being a dog, and they do not smell good to me, either, but I buy these regularly and the ones I purchased here are the best price I have seen!"
358,B0026RQTGE,5,Minty Fresh Breathe,"When I first picked up my puppy, he didn't like any treats.  I was worried and asked  a co-worker about what treats his dog likes.  He mentioned how much his dog liked the greenies.  I went to the store, picked up a bag and I have been giving my puppy a greenie ever since.  He LOVES them and his breathe is much more fresh now.  His favorite treat."
359,B0026RQTGE,5,Wonderful Chewy Healthy Treat,"My yorky absolutely loves Greenies Chews.  They are good for him so I am very glad that he likes them so well.  They have a pleasant smell even to me.  My cats love greenies too, the feline variety.  I recommend them highly!"
360,B0026RQTGE,5,Best Dog Treats,"My dog loves these treats.  He gets one every morning after he goes outside, and waits by the treat cabinet to get it.  They seem to be working great for his teeth.  We never brush his teeth, he's six years old, and the vet just said he doesn't need to have a teeth cleaning as his teeth look great.  I wish these were available on a subscription so they'd just come automatically!"
361,B0026RQTGE,5,AM NEVER WITHOUT TEENIE GREENIES,I've got two adopted rescue Chihuahuas . . . they would run me out of town on a rail if they didn't get their daily Teenie Greenies . . . Amazon has the best price around for this product . . . it's a winner all around . . .
362,B0026RQTGE,5,Much Cheaper then in Stores!,"This is a great deal! At $25 per bag at the local pet store, I couldn't afford them (I have three dogs!). Now I can order these anytime."
363,B0026RQTGE,5,My 2 Dachshunds love these,My two little boys love these treats. So much in fact that I've been cutting them in half so they can have them more than once a day. I honestly can't say that they reduce tartar but I can see how they would with their chewy texture.
364,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love them,"I have 3 90 pound dogs and I buy these in the 27 count boxes 2 at a time.<br />Each dog chews them as if they are munching on gold. It's like they are savoring each bite which is all the better for cleaning their teeth.<br />My veterinarian even noticed a difference in my dogs teeth after only 2 weeks. Like another contributor, I give them last thing at night before bed and I have don't know if the 2 are related but night time doggie gas has all but disappeared as well.......LOL"
365,B0026RQTGE,5,Great dental treats...,"Our Shiba loves these. Over a three week period we have observed a reasonable reduction in the amount of tarter on his teeth, especially the molars.<br /><br />We would continue to buy them from Amazon if the price were lower. However, a large shopper's club sells essentially the same product (ingredients, and including the capped box and inner packaging), while offering the product at a consistently lower cost: 10%-12% per unit."
366,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love them,Good price. I'm not sure how they help with their teeth but my one dog just had teeth cleaned and just started giving these to her so will see if it's worth the price at the vet.
367,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Doggie Treats,My little pom absolutely loves the Greenies Dental Chews. Amazon provides the bigger pack of 96 at a cheaper price than you can find in stores. When they arrived today I told my dog her treats were here and she knew exactly what I was talking about. She was jumping up and down and could hardly wait for me to open the package. As soon as I got it opened she grabbed her little Greenie and went to town!!
368,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are a great treat,"I have 2 boxers. 1 is 16 mos. and the other is 11 months. The older one, often gets what my husband and I call ""shrimp breath"". The younger one has lots of digestive issues. They both get 1 greenie a week. Vet says their teeth look great and it's helped with the bad breath. Also, doesn't give the little one runny poop, which is nice. Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week."
369,B0026RQTGE,5,my dog loves Greenies,"My dog, Shadow,  loves Greenies more than any treat. He's a Pomeranian and gets the Teenies, and are we in trouble if we run out!  I just bought the tub of 96 on Amazon for less than half the money that the small packages cost at the store. Debbie"
370,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love it,"I'm not sure this helps the tarter since my dogs need their teeth cleaned every other year but I can tell you they really love this stuff.  It does seem to help their breath, probably by settling their stomachs, and they never had a bad reaction to this treat."
371,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs Love,"All 3 of my dogs-pom, yorkie, rat terrier, love these. I just received my 2nd order. Wish these were on sub. and save."
372,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,My dogs love the greenies and their breath is alway good smelling. A good product.<br />I purchased this through Amazon for a better prlice than I normally get.  This is an expensive little treat but worth it.
373,B0026RQTGE,5,Excellent deal!,Best deal on greenies out there! Came fast and without any problems. My dog loves them and they make his breath smell good.
374,B0026RQTGE,5,Freshens breath and my Yorkie loves 'em!!,"When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!"
375,B0026RQTGE,5,It's like crack for dogs,"These things aren't cheap, but there's nothing that gets my dog more excited than the thought of getting a Greenie. Whatever is inside of them is something he can't get enough of. I don't know about whether they are healthy, they don't seem to clean his teeth, but they certainly make him a very happy pooch."
376,B0026RQTGE,5,Best price - great quality product,My dog loves these things - one in the morning<br /><br />Everyone makes a compliment  on her breath smelling good
377,B0026RQTGE,5,Absolutely fabulous,"I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog."
378,B0026RQTGE,5,Great product for your dog !,"Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean. My dog gets excited about being treated to a Greenie everyday. The pricing was very attractive through Amazon, as much as half of what you would pay at a pet store. Very impressed with the product."
379,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dog loves this,"Well, the ingredients list is a little questionable to me personally.<br />However, after comparing to most other brands, such as Nylabone, Pegetables etc, they all seem the same.<br />This is economically priced so it does not break the bank.<br />My dog loves and goes crazy for it, and I haven't heard of any problems/recalls with this product.<br /><br />So overall, it's great I guess."
380,B0026RQTGE,5,My greyhounds love teenie greenies,"I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the ""large or X-Lg"" greenie where you get fewer pieces."
381,B0026RQTGE,5,It does work!,Our cute little dog had the breath from hell! This product actually works! She loves them as treats and her breath is waaaaaaay better!
382,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love 'em,"Our dogs love these.  The vet always compliments us on brushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.  (Seriously, if someone has ever accomplished this without the dog making various dramatic escape attempts and trying to eat the toothpaste, please tell me your secret.)  We just give them each one of these every day and a bunch of rawhide to chew on, seems to do the trick."
383,B0026RQTGE,5,Great  Buy,"Exactly what I ordered. Product was just as if I had bought it in the store, only a way better deal. Fast shipment. Very satisfied with this transaction. will definitely do business with this merchant again if they have what I am in the market for."
384,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog  loves them,"Maddie loves her greenie treats,she would eat the whole box if I allowed her..The treats are very special to her..As soon as I give her one she heads for the couch, away from everybody,so she can relish her treat in private...Also good for her teeth..Great treats for my little dog..very pleased with them"
385,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are good!,"For the past 5 years my dog has been starting his day with a greenie.  He still gets excited about this morning treat and appears disappointed when I run out.  Since he controls the household, I buy them."
386,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Dental Chews,"My dog, a 13 year old Bichon Frise' has been loving these Greenies for many years. Our vet says that his teeth and gums are excellent although he has never had his teeth cleaned or brushed. Could it be the Greenies? I'm sure of it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KEVF32"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Regular, Pack of 27</a>"
387,B0026RQTGE,5,GREAT SNACK,"We get the Regular and the Petite, for after meal or instead of meal treats.  Brutus and Popeye review this product at 12 out of 10!  Until we tried Greenies, Brutus turned his nose up on almost everything we gave him.  Now he has something he really enjoys.  Popeye, on the other hand, is a different story.  He would eat the box, so we can't use him as a judge."
388,B0026RQTGE,5,My fussy little dog's favorite treat,"I usually buy these at the pet store, but the price was great, and the product arrived fresh. These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed."
389,B0026RQTGE,5,Excellent product,Our dog loves these and our vet agrees that it helps keep her breath fresh and her teeth clean.  And this is the best pricing I've found so far. Your dog will love you even more!
390,B0026RQTGE,5,Gives dog great breath,"These are a bit expensive but when it comes to your pet, especially one with bad breat like mine, it's worth it. My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh. It's also grt for their teeth, she hasn't had to have her teeth cleaned at the vet once since she started eating these."
391,B0026RQTGE,5,greenies work,"I wish these things weren't so expensive, because they're the only thing that seems to work for my dog's AWFUL breath!"
392,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Rock!,I used to buy these at Petsmart - not anymore!  Same exact product considerably cheaper.  I usually tack them on to other orders to take advantage of free shipping.  God forbid I don't have a supply of Greenies in the house...
393,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are treats!,"My dog loves these!  He has learned the word 'greenie'! It's good for him but he treats it like a favored treat.  I only use one a day, but he has accepted that and loves them.  They are good for his teeth - he has better teeth than I do!"
394,B0026RQTGE,4,dog loves them,This is a great product to help maintain dog dental care. My dog looks forward to getting her treat every night
395,B0026RQTGE,4,the Wonder Dog's Favorite,"My vet recommended these, and the Wonder Dog loves them! They're a bit pricey and smell terrible to me, but apparently smell great to a dog!"
396,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies teeth biscuits,"I love this product!  My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting brown in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :)"
397,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog love them and one of these works for about 3 to 4 days on our boxer.,"These are ""minis"" but seriously plenty for even a bigger dog like a boxer.  We give it to Mocha about 2 to 3 times a week to keep here breath from smelling like the crypt keepers shorts . . ."
398,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love these,"I have never seen my dogs as happy as when they seem me take out the greenies bag.  They are pricey but, what can you do?"
399,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Dog Chews,"This was an awesome deal!  I will absolutely continue to buy these through Amazon, now I have 2 dogs and it would have been getting really costly at the old place I purchased them from.  Thank you!!"
400,B0026RQTGE,5,Great treat,I have two rescue Beagles and they get one Greenie per day.  Geat treat and they love them.  Also good for their teeth.
401,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are the bomb!,We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!
402,B0026RQTGE,5,"Happy dog, happy customer","My dog goes crazy for these. He won't touch the Virbac dog chews. He's not a chewer, so the fact that he will chew these means they must taste really good. They're expensive, but because my dog will eat them, it's worth the cost."
403,B0026RQTGE,5,My Lab's favorite bedtime treat,"I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that ""tail-wagging drool"" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)"
404,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are GREAT!!!,I have two dogs that are absolutely nuts for Greenies!! One dog is so picky about what he eats that it really suprised me that one of his favorite things would be a Greenie!
405,B0026RQTGE,5,"A little pricey, but worth the $","Our full sized Goldendoodle gets one every day.  According to our vet, his teeth and gums ""look great"".  I also have purchased the feline greenies for my daughter when she complained that hr cat had ""bad breath"".  3 chews/3 days later=no more bad breath."
406,B0026RQTGE,5,My pups really like them!,"Both my Maltese and Chiweenie pup really dig these greenie's. I break the teenies in half for the chiweenie to spare the money.  Just like the people food, the healthier, the more pricey. But they do like these and would rather the greenies than anything else. 2nd time purchasing from here and shipment is quick and easy.  I am a student prime member- FREE FOR A YEAR!"
407,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are Great,"When I got my dog he was 6 and had recently had his teeth cleaned.  Now he is 13 and, with eating a greenie a day, has not needed to have them done again.  He loves these treats!"
408,B0026RQTGE,5,My Boxer's favorite treat!,"My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon, like it's her treat for being such a good girl all day.  So funny!"
409,B0026RQTGE,4,Only thing my dog will eat.,"I have a 3 year old Siberian Husky, who has to be the pickiest dog in the world. He will go days without eating if I don't give him exactly what he wants. I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done."
410,B0026RQTGE,5,Good product for teeth,My dog likes the Greenies. They seem to be a little more than other products of this type. But they do appear worth the money as they are well liked by pooches and do the job of cleaning teeth well.
411,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"We've been buying Greenies for our two dachshunds for many years now. The dogs love them, and they seem to be good for the dogs. We plan to keep it up."
412,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"My dog has been eating these after his dinner for years. They keep his breath clean and limit the build up of plac. He waits with anticipation his greenie after his meal, running to get one out of my hand. Digestion has been no problem at all and the formula is soft enough to prevent any form of choking. I would highly recommend this product."
413,B0026RQTGE,5,Love those Greenies,"My 3 hounds (2 small, one large) have one of these after breakfast every morning.  They know the routine and go stare at the box as soon as they come in from breakfast.  Just the right size snack and it cleans their teeth and breath.  Good stuff."
414,B0026RQTGE,5,Good Treat,"I'm not sure what's in these. Very odd odor & texture, but my dog absolutely loves them.  They also help calm her stomach and clean her teeth.  I've gotten these for her before at the local pet superstore, and found them on here for a few bucks cheaper.  Great seller and fast shipping."
415,B0026RQTGE,5,Crazy over Greenies!!!,"I have two cocker spaniels that are absolutely crazy over Greenies, we have to spell it out and they still know what it is! All I know is that if it makes my dogs this happy then it makes me happy!"
416,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies at a Great Price!,My dogs love Greenies. They are a healthy chewing snack for dogs. I was pleased to purchase Greenies at such a great price. I paid under $23.00 for a tub of 96 tiny Greenies. The same package sells for at least $10 to $15 more for the same product. I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.com.
417,B0026RQTGE,5,Big Dane - little treat,"Our Great Dane prefers Greenies over any other treat.  She really likes the small ones.  Because they are expensive we limit her to one ""special Greenie"" a week.  She knows when we get the box down and gets very excited."
418,B0026RQTGE,5,Love these!,"Greenies are wonderful, my dog loves them and chews them up! I don't notice much as far as better breath, but I already brush his teeth and scale them. He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)<br /><br />(To the bad reviews/comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)"
419,B0026RQTGE,4,Works well but too dense,"My dog likes to chew it but it's ""heavy weight"" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here."
420,B0026RQTGE,5,dog treats,These are the BEST dog treats EVER!!!  Thanks for the prompt service and good pricing!  Check out goodpersontest.net.
421,B0026RQTGE,5,"son excelentes, les encantan a mis perritos y le mantienen el aliento fresco. llegaron a tiempo y en perfecto estado.","Son excelentes, les encantan a mis perritos y le mantienen el aliento fresco. llegaron a tiempo y en perfecto estado. estoy satisfecha con el producto y el envio."
422,B0026RQTGE,4,Dog Loves Treats,My dog loves these treats and I give one as a reward after I brush his teeth.  I can't determine at this point if they help clean his teeth.
423,B0026RQTGE,4,Greenie$,"Good product & my dogs love them. But, over priced like most Pet treats.<br />I did get fast delivery & good service as usual."
424,B0026RQTGE,4,Greenies #27 regular size,"A great treat that your dogs will love. Even our slightly picky dogs love these treats. They clean their teeth too! Also, they don't smell like some rawhides and other natural products. I wish the lasted a little longer - our larger dog eats his in a couple of minutes."
425,B0026RQTGE,4,Our 3 dogs love greenies,"Our three dogs, 2 Cairn Terriers (5 & 4) and a 15+ year old border collie are proud of their Greenies. They like the taste and it helps keep their gums and teeth in good shape."
426,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great price, great product!","I have given my dog greenies before, and he LOVES them!  Moreover, I love the fact that they keep his teeth and gums clean and healthy!  Buying through Amazon is so much cheaper than buying at a petstore, and I love the storage box that the greenies came in!  Highly reccommend, but be sure to buy the correct size treats for your pup!"
427,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"Love em, love em, love em.  Need a bigger box I think.  Better than paying for a dentist thats for sure.  Remember to brush>  All paws up on this"
428,B0026RQTGE,5,Best chews ever!,We have been giving these dental chews to our little Pomeranian for over 3 years now. The vet always says we do a great job with brushing her teeth and gums although it is these chewies that do the job! Highly recommended!
429,B0026RQTGE,5,love them,our dogs love greenies. we give them greenies that are smaller than recommended for their size though because they are quite expensive but they still do a nice job of cleaning up their breath.
430,B0026RQTGE,5,awesome!,"My dog won't chew rawhides or any bone really, I've tried them all. After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.  I think the bones are a little on the small side, so next time I'll go up a size, so it'll last longer."
431,B0026RQTGE,4,The dogs love it.,Nothing wrong with this product as far as the dogs are concerned.  They always want more than just one a day but we try to limit them to that amount for their own good and our pocket book.
432,B0026RQTGE,5,dogs love them,"My dogs love these, and everything I've read suggests that they're good for the dogs, especially for the dogs' teeth. One of my dogs sometimes won't eat her regular food, or will eat it slowly, but she will always eat her Greenies right away."
433,B0026RQTGE,5,Yummy Greenies,My two yorkie/apso dogs come in from morning outing and get all excited waiting for their Greenie.  They've been getting one teenie size every morning for only 2 months - but their teeth and breath are looking and smelling good.  I recommend this healthy treat.
434,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog loves them,The new Greenies are so much easier for our dog to chew up. She only gets 1-2 per week but enjoys them each time. Buying them via Amazon always saves us money.
435,B0026RQTGE,5,My Dog Goes CRAZY!!,"I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."
436,B0026RQTGE,5,My Pooch loves them,"Since my pet does not like having his teeth cleaned, I have been giving him greenies for the past six years.  Each vet check-up confirms that he has no plaque buildup.  He is a picky eater but loves the taste of them as well."
437,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are a plus for dogs teeth.,I buy greenies for  my two best friends.  My vet commented on how their teeth are looking good because of the greenies.  My ten year old Scottish terrier and my four year old Standard Poodle will dance circles for their greenis..lol.  How cool is that?
438,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for Owen,Our Newf Owen is a Senior citizen now so wanted to switch him over to a treat that fit his mature lifestyle.  He loves these just as he did the regular Greenies.
439,B0026RQTGE,5,My chihuahua loves'em !!!!!!!!!!,"Seriously, my dog goes absolutely bats#*t crazy over these things! Her teeth are cleaner, and her breath is nice and fresh. Highly recommended."
440,B0026RQTGE,5,Great deal,"Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy-bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50/ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping."
441,B0026RQTGE,5,"Can't beat this price, came super fast.",Excellent product. Your dogs will love them. I wouldn't recommend them for dogs over 25 pounds as they may pose a choking hazard for quick eaters.
442,B0026RQTGE,5,Good Price,Buying the greenies online is the way to go..  They cost about $10 cheaper than if you were to walk into a chain pet store.
443,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them,Vet recommended them for my small dogs due to dental problems.  They enjoy them a lot.
444,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenie Treats,My little girl doggie loves these..and great for her teeth.  Less expensive than at the pet store when I buy four it's like getting one free!  Great product!
445,B0026RQTGE,4,My poodle loves these,These are a great training aid for dogs because they seem to like them so much.  I have one dog but have offered them to others as well when I go to the dog park.  I have had great luck using these for rewards when she follows the commands.
446,B0026RQTGE,5,Best Price,"For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally.  My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that.  The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness."
447,B0026RQTGE,5,My pugs favorite dental treat & works!,I've had my pug Koa for over 6 years now. Since 2 years I've been providing him with greenies and he just loves it!  Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.  But with purchasing different pricing each time through Amazon is something I don't understand.  It would be great for return loyal patrons to purchase same price or honor discount pricing.
448,B0026RQTGE,5,the best reward/bribe ever,"I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in. And Greenies are good for their breath/teeth, healthy and easily digestible. My vet, too, recommends them."
449,B0026RQTGE,5,great,My dog (maltese-) loves greenies. It's her fav treat and knowing that is good for her and is cleaning her teeth makes me feel great !! ;)
450,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs devour greenies.,My dogs absolutely love greenies and any time I can save money buying them that's a plus.  They are twice the price at any pet or grocery store.
451,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,Received as promised. What can you say about dog treats? I personally haven't tasted one! lol Shipper was prompt for delivery.
452,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are great,"My dog is so picky,but when it comes to geenies,he loves them.<br />So to me,greenies are a heathy treat and helps keep his teath clean.<br />Thank you greenies"
453,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"My two little Italian Greyhounds love Greenies. I did buy the wrong size Greenies this time. I usually buy the teenie Greenies with 96 in the package for aprox the same price, but I must have hit the wrong size product. Not too big a deal, I just break them in 1/2.<br />The product arrived very quickly and I will be certain to order again in the future....thought I will be sure to order the correct size next time!"
454,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog is worth it,Greenies are recommended for dog dental care and this is the best price I can find and free shipping.
455,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies...yum!!!,"Between 11:30 and noon every day, my dog starts to hound us for his one a day Greenie! He loves them, and they have his veterinarian's approval. This is a great product...I've used it for years. The site is easy to navigate, and delivery is always prompt."
456,B0026RQTGE,5,Our pet loves greenies,"Our pet loves having greenies as treat, she gets crazy every time she hears or see us opening the package. Her breath also gets better after eating her treat."
457,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog Dental Chews,Our dogs like their Greenie in the morning. It makes them happy and also helps to reduce their dog breath. I don't know that it provides any other dental advantages.
458,B0026RQTGE,5,Great!,My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.  He gets one per day and always lets me know when it is time to have one.  The cost is a little high so I buy them in the larger quantity.
459,B0026RQTGE,5,Always a great choice,I buy these time and time again. I noticed an immediate improvement in my dog's breath (no stink...he gets in my face all the time) and there's no plaque on his teeth.
460,B0026RQTGE,5,M PUPPY LOVES THESE,My 1yr old pup loves greenies. He's been snacking on these since he was a month old. His breath always smells great and no tummy aches.
461,B0026RQTGE,5,We have to call them Gs,"Our dog knows the word Greenies so we have to call them Gs, but never to her! We don't want to have to come up with another name. These are an absolute must. The dog must have them. That is all there is to it. The fact that we could find the ""lite"" greenies was an added bonus."
462,B0026RQTGE,5,Proof is in the Vet's Bill,"My ""Sammy"" is very picky on treats but he loves these and the best thing is he is 7 and a half years old and has never had to have his teeth cleaned. The Vet says his teeth are clear of tartar so I've saved enough in Vet bills to more than pay for his special chews"
463,B0026RQTGE,5,#1 dog treat!,"These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole."
464,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies - Buddy's #1 Treat,"As always, the perfect snack for my dog.  He just loves them and knows exactly when it is 8:00 p.m. and starts to ask for his!!!  As that is the time of evening he gets his ""Greenie"" snack"".  Thank you for the excellent product and fast delivery."
465,B0026RQTGE,5,"Greenies Dental Treats for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 27 oz, 96 chews","My two babies just LOVE this product - they cannot get enough.  They usually get their treat just before bedtime.  When they know the time is nearing, they sit on the bed and anxiously await their bedtime treat.  Although the bones are small, I cut each bone into four pieces so they think they are getting multiple bones.  This item is a win win for my little ones!!"
466,B0026RQTGE,5,My picky dog LOVES these!,My small Westie terrier absolutely loves his Greenies! I had other Westies in the past years and these were also their favorite treat. The company was sold and they changed the formula years ago and made them safer for the dogs to eat. They are the BEST!
467,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Value=Happy Dogs,We ordered this after paying pet store prices for greenies for our 5 dogs and this has been a godsend! Larger container and affordable price I would be remiss to ever get them anywhere else again!
468,B0026RQTGE,5,Dycee's Mom,"I don't know much from a personal point of view, but Dycee say's they're necessary. She loves them and wouldn't be a very happy pooch without them. If you have a dog, you probably know what I mean. This is one of her MUST HAVES."
469,B0026RQTGE,5,Serious Dog Joy,"Greenies are an great product - they are very attractive to my dog, who can be picky about treats, and provide a good chew that helps address his tartar problems, and Amazon has among the best price I've found.<br /><br />As long as you have someplace out of dog-nose reach to store the box, Greenies are a great way to help your dogs teeth stay clean and thus avoid the further health issues that result from canine dental problems."
470,B0026RQTGE,5,my dog would like to give them 6 stars,"My dog is goofy enough but when he knows one of these are comming,  he really goes nuts.  I did not have a hitch in the order or length of time getting them. Thank you so much, Linda Turner I would recommend ordering these to anyone. Greenies have been a part of my dogs lives for nearly thirteen years and they look forward to one everyday. I ordered them from Amazon and everything went smoothly."
471,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Treat,I have three dogs and they get a greenie every day.  You will be amazed to see what these treats can do for your dogs teeth.  Buy on Amazon for the best value.  Some stores sell these for more than $30 a box.
472,B0026RQTGE,5,"Good Greats, Good Quality, Good Product",This is a great product that most dogs absolutely love. It's great for the teeth and great for their morale. I give my coton a treat every morning when I leave for work. The product on Amazon is considerably cheaper than it is at the local petstore and the 96 size is perfect for dogs under 20lbs.
473,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love Greenies,"Dogs LOVE Greenies!  They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!"
474,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Review,"Greenies have been a part of my dogs lives for nearly thirteen years and they look forward to one everyday.  I ordered them from Amazon and everything went smoothly.  I did not have a hitch in the order or length of time getting them. Thank you so much, Linda Turner  I would recommend ordering these to anyone."
475,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog Treats,My dogs love their Greenies.  I would buy 6 to save money. It is a must for treat time. All I have to do is say Greenies and you see the tails wag.
476,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenie Clean!,"My dog loves these, This was an awesome price too! These are sometimes 40 bucks at the stores for a 27 pack. I will def buy these again."
477,B0026RQTGE,5,Great buy,"My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still brush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half."
478,B0026RQTGE,4,Our three dogs are addicted to Greenies!,Our three dogs are addicted to Greenies. Even at one treat per day it has become an expensive habit but one we are willing to promote.  We were thrilled to find such a great price and free shipping!
479,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies dog treats,These to are a very good way to help keep my dog's teeth and gums clean and she loves them too.
480,B0026RQTGE,5,greeenies,my dog loves these...he would eat these things for regular food if you would let him.  breath is also wonderful.
481,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies - Buddy's #1 Treat,"Greenies Bones are the best treat my dog of 11 years can think of!  Even after all of these years, they remain his #1 favorite - looked forward to - every evening - extra special - treat - no bones about it !!!!! Very affordable pricing and shipping.  Would recommend seller and will be buying more from them myself!"
482,B0026RQTGE,5,~ Fantastic Price On Greenies ~ One Happy Pomeranian! ~,"Our Pomeranian LOVES Greenies, But I Was Getting Really Tired Of Spending Almost 50 Dollars A Pack At The Local Pet Store, So I Decided To Check On Amazon. I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.<br />The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!"
483,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs have clean teeth,"My dogs get their Greenies at noon, can hardly wait to gnaw on them, and and then chew heartly until the Greenies disappear.  The good news is that all my dogs now have clean teeth."
484,B0026RQTGE,5,It's Great! My dog loves it.,"Just small enough, but not too big for my dog. He loves it and it helps keep his teeth clean."
485,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love these!,My dogs love these. They each get one a day. Amazon's prices are great! Thanks...
486,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog's favorite,"My jack russell, Didi, absolutely loves Greenies!  All I have to say is, ""Do you want a greenie?"", and her little head cocks to the side and she runs to the Greenies bag.  A greenie a day makes your dog very happy!!"
487,B0026RQTGE,5,Great price,I found this site to have the best price for the quantities on the web. I would definitely order from here again.
488,B0026RQTGE,5,My Animals love Greenies,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBFKIQ"">Greenies Dental Treats for Dogs, Petite Pack, 27 oz, 45 chews</a><br />My chihuahuas love Greenies and will do anything to get one. My cats also love Cat Greenies. I use the Greenies Pill Pockets to give my animals pills and/or vitamins.  Great product and good for them also. Make great training tools... Greenies come in the size to fit your dog. Chihuahua size treats are hard to find. I highly recommend Greenies for dogs and cats."
489,B0026RQTGE,5,"Love, love, love","My mini poodle loves these greenies...his groomer also uses them and we just went to a vet who was also familiar with them....all dogs seem to love these ""toothbrushes""...highly recommend them.."
490,B0026RQTGE,5,Does what it supposed to,"I don't know about others, but my dog loves these.  He's a 55lbs golden retriever mix puppy, and loves to chew.  Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product."
491,B0026RQTGE,5,Greeenies are a great treat!,"My small dog loves his greenies. I give him a greenie after dinner. Goodness, if I forget he sure remembers it's time for his delicious treat. These are great at keeping his teeth clean. I still brush his teeth once a week, but these help keep his teeth healthy and strong between brushes."
492,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are Great,These are great for our dog and the price is great on Amazon.com for the large package.
493,B0026RQTGE,5,She loves it!!,"I adopted my dog because her previous owner had passed away.  My dog had been eating canned food and her teeth looked terrible.  I tried a couple of teeth whitening treats and toys, but Bailey would have nothing to do with them.  Then I found Greenies and she loves them.  Once she left a couple puddles of saliva on the floor as I was getting out a greenie for her, she was salivating so much.  Her teeth look so much better now and her breath is great."
494,B0026RQTGE,5,Bow Wow Yum,"Both of my dogs will practically sell their souls for a greenie treat.  They know that this is the sign that it is time to go into their crates for the evening and after getting a greenie, they willingly go to bed."
495,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Buy,"Great buy for the great product, it saves me money and i don't even have to leave my house. I will buy this product again from amazon only."
496,B0026RQTGE,5,goodies for dog,My friend gave me some of these greenies that were left from her dog.  I gave my dog one and he was sold.  Never thought he would eat these.  Good breath now and also is a picky eater...Quick delivery and good price.
497,B0026RQTGE,4,My dogs' favorite treat by far.,"My dogs are absolutely addicted to these.  Never had any digestion problems.  They keep my chihuahua's teeth super clean, my beagle/dachund's teeth need a little more help.  I personally don't care for the smell of them, but it's really not too bad."
498,B0026RQTGE,5,Highly Recommended,"I ordered these on sale on the evening of 02/08/10,( ususlly with an item on sale such as this, you get gouged on the shipping/processing fees, but that was not the case with this vendor!) and they were on my doorstep on 2/11/10. Excellent communications from this vendor, with an email order confirmation,and an order shipped/tracking confirmation, and super fast shipping. A++"
499,B0026RQTGE,5,What a great price for greenies!,"We used to get greenies from Petco, what an amazing price difference this is!  Our beagle eats one every day and it keeps her breath in check."
500,B0026RQTGE,5,Our greyhound loves them,"Looking for a treat that will never be refused, or left lying around?  Our greyhound loves Greenies and the Greenies are doing a great job of keeping his teeth in good shape."
501,B0026RQTGE,5,Happy Customer,I am not only very happy with this product but am also very happy with the service and the speedy delivery
502,B0026RQTGE,5,dog treat,My vet told me to have my dog get these to help with her teeth and she loves them
503,B0026RQTGE,5,AMAZING!,My dogs eat a greenie everymorning and they are so expensive everywhere in the stores! I was so happy to find some many of them for such an inexpensive price!! such a great deal!!
504,B0026RQTGE,5,Good price.,"I buy these locally, and they are more expensive than Amazon.com.<br />My dog likes them and we do see a difference in her teeth.<br />Thanks."
505,B0026RQTGE,5,GRRRRRREAT!,I have no personal experience with Greenies but my dog loves them.  Her rating is grrrreat!
506,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog can't live without these!,"Because our dog has to have his greenie every day, we have to make sure we have them on hand at all times.  The price was great, the shipment arrived promptly and the main thing is our dog is happy.<br />B. Stephens"
507,B0026RQTGE,5,Definitely will purchase from buyer in the future,Encountered 0 problems with this buyer. Received products as pictured/ordered in a timely manner. Packaged securely and safe to ensure no problems during delivery of shipment
508,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog would do anything for Greenies,"My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs."
509,B0026RQTGE,4,Great price for this product,This is a terrific price for this product and quantity. The package always arrives early.
510,B0026RQTGE,5,good greenies,"Our girls have to have their Greenies before bedtime. They are 30 and 40 lb border collies, but we give them the Teenie Greenies, sometimes two, they go NUTS over them!"
511,B0026RQTGE,5,My doggie hates everything but loves these!,My doggie goes crazy when he hears the box being opened. He has sensitive teeth and doesnt like hard stuff. These are perfect. I started using these after getting his teeth cleaned. I give him one every 2-3 days. Keeping his teeth clean.
512,B0026RQTGE,5,yummy yummy,My dogs LOVE Greenies!!  I have offered them a choice of Greenies or Nutri Dent several times......Greenies are their choice every time.  The Nutri Dents just don't cut it with them.  Greenies are the best!!!!
513,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love Greenies!,"I give my dog 1 Greenie in the morning, he loves them and the vet that he goes to says they are the best for keeping their teeth strong and clean.<br />I highly recommend these for your dog or cat for the health of it."
514,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Supplier,"Product delivered quickly and item was as advertised.  No complaints here, I recommend this seller on a very high scale.  Keep up the good work and your customers will be well pleased."
515,B0026RQTGE,5,Can't live without greenies,My cavalier king charles spaniel and a friend's beagle can't survive without greenies!!!  Fantastic product and great seller...
516,B0026RQTGE,5,Excellent Vendor,Superb business.  I do not think this item could have been shipped and received any quicker unless I had driven to a local store and picked it up myself.  Wish all Internet businesses would strive to do transaction this way.  Adds confidence and credibility to the e-commerce world.
517,B0026RQTGE,5,Best deal on Greenies,"Most dogs LOVE Greenies, and they are supposed to be great for their teeth, but they are also quite expensive. I found this 96 count package on Amazon for under 25.00!!!! Note that this is the petite size as I have little dogs, so if you are looking for the larger Greenies you need to check the pricing. The product arrived within a couple of days, and is a great value. Normally a package of 6 or so petite Greenies cost aprox 7.00!"
518,B0026RQTGE,5,Beach Granny,My dog loves his Greenies. I give him one in the evening hoping that it cleans his teeth.
519,B0026RQTGE,5,GREAT !!,This is a FANTASTIC price on Greenies and my dog cannot live without having at least 1 a day ! Thanks for a great product at a great price !
520,B0026RQTGE,5,Good things!,My dog loves Greenies Treats and because they are good fo rher that makes them even better!
521,B0026RQTGE,5,My Maltese gets one a night.,This is her goodnight treat.  She loves these.  We do not give her more then one a day and we like the teenie size the best.
522,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs love it,"I always buy these on line for the dogs because the pet stores and grocery store prices are four times more.  For my small 10 pound dogs, I should have bought the teenie vice petite size though.  Great product."
523,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Price and My dog just loves 'em!,"My Mom and Dad loved the price, and I just think these are way yummy. Keep 'em coming I say! As for delivery time, they ordered them and we had them in a box within a few days. Not quite as fast as the pet store, but they say for less money - even with shipping. Personally, I need them more frequently than my parents give them to me, please can I have another greenie, I love minty fresh breath! I'll be good! by Alex a Vizsla"
524,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies good product but price has gone up,I have been buying this product for quite some time. My dogs love them. I was disappointed at how much the price went up recently. I was also angry when I got my purchase which was advertised as 19 in a box and there were only 17.
525,B0026RQTGE,5,Papillions Love Greenies!,"Our Papillions love Greenies!  They help keep the tartar under control.  This breed is notorious for bad tartar build up on their teeth and having to have dentals twice a year.  With using the Greenies daily, they only have to have a dental once a year.  This saves us over $400/year."
526,B0026RQTGE,5,my dog loves greenies,"My dog loves Greenies treats, so I ordered him a big box for his Christmas gift.  He's been enjoying one every day.  I feel good feeding him these treats because they are recommended by my Vet and they are a natural treat that he enjoys."
527,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,My dog loves the Greenies. He is a 12lbs pug and the Tiny size were too small for him.  These are a better size for him.  He loves them.  He recently decided that he didn't like many of his treats but he still loves these.
528,B0026RQTGE,5,"Yummy and Good-for-you, Too!","These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The ""Regular"" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs."
529,B0026RQTGE,5,New Softer Greenies,"I do like that the Greenies are softer, more chewable.  I feel it makes the product a little bit safer for my dogs to have."
530,B0026RQTGE,1,Bad for My Dog,"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out."
531,B0026RQTGE,2,Greenies Treats,Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.
532,B0026RQTGE,2,Contradicting photo and description!,"There is contradicting information.  The description says Senior Greenie Large, while the photo shows ""regular"" as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce.  Anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated."
533,B0026RQTGE,5,great product,"I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area. I have read other reviews where people have had trouble with their dogs trying to chew off too much and choking or what-ever - my solution stay with your dog as they chew anything this is just plain common sense. I also give it after his evening meal so that he won't try to swallow to big of bites."
534,B0026RQTGE,4,Very good value - but manufacturer should switch to a larger bulk bag,"This was an Excellent value of buying on Amazon versus the pet stores.<br />It was packaged and labeled well for shipment.<br /><br />However - the manufacturer's plastic top of the box itself is a little cheap and less functional than I expected.  Frankly, the whole top has to come off each time I want to give my dog a single chew.<br /><br />So - I'm actually putting these chews into a Dog treat jar that has a open-and-close top with a tab.<br /><br />The manufacturer could simply change the bulk packaging to a bag.  Frankly, a Ziploc bag would be just as functional (and probably have a lower manufacturing cost) than the box."
535,B0026RQTGE,5,Suppliers Make All the Difference!,"Since all Greenies are the same I would suppose that only the suppliers of Greenies could make the difference, and this one certainly did!<br />We received our order for an amazing cocker spaniel in very good time, which made us all very happy!<br />And as far as price goes, that was really a surprise!<br />Even with postage these healthy treats cost less than we had been paying for them in pet stores here in Salt Lake City!<br />You can surely look forward to many more orders from us!<br />Thanks for the great treatment!!!!<br />Ray, Joan and Taz<br /><br />PS  I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THE IDENTIFYING PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT I REVIEWED GOT SWITCHED!<br /><br />HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DOG EAT THE MICROFIBER CLOTHS (EVEN THE GREEN ONES)!!!!!!!!!"
536,B0026RQTGE,5,"The pet dog is delighted, too!","I gave a pet dog plural resemblance products, but have got tired directly so far.<br />However, the pet dog continues Greenies and wants it."
537,B0026RQTGE,5,Wonderful Treat,"My Shih Tzu is seven and has had one Greenie a day for years.  She is happy, healthy and has great teeth.  She begs for her Greenie every morning.  Don't worry about Greenies causing allergies!  The main source of allergies is CORN in dog food.  Do your little one a favor and go to a grain free or reduced grain dog food.  When you think about it, wild dogs didn't eat corn meal!  If your little one has allergies, you will be amazed at the immediate healing."
538,B0026RQTGE,5,"Excellent seller, excellent service, excellent prices!","I would not only order from this seller again, I have also told all my friends about this seller's store!"
539,B0026RQTGE,2,Great product... Misleading product picture.,"My AKC English Bulldog has been using greenies since he was a puppy, and hasnt had any problems with it. Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart."
540,B0026RQTGE,5,Another happy dog and owner,I am sad to say that my dogs are completely addicted to Greenies. They get one every night after our walk and they never let us forget. Once we get inside they go right to their crates and sit and wait until their treats are given. Good treat for small dogs and a great price on amazon.
541,B0026RQTGE,5,Terrific Product for Doggie Breath!,"The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the ""bricks & mortar"" stores; and I plan to order another box.  We received the product a few days after placing the order.<br /><br />Terrific product, and our lab loves this treat!"
542,B0026RQTGE,5,brandi,my dog brandi lovessssssssssssssssssss these greenies she cant get enough of them and i keep them in cabinet she will look at cabinet and than look at me and say ma can i please have a greenie im not kiddin shes a dog but she talks to me they have there own communication.<br />anyway whoever is leary about buying these trust me when i tell you they are worth every pennie and this seller got them out to me quick!!great product great seller what more can i say but<br />merry xmas and a happy healthy new year too!!
543,B0026RQTGE,5,our dogs love them,Our two greyhounds love the Greenies dental chews.  I prefer to buy them the smaller treats since they are both seniors now and don't like to chew on things for extended periods of time.  The regular size fits that need.
544,B0026RQTGE,3,Full of worms,"When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot."
545,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Deal,"As always, amazing price on amazon. Paid the same price for 45 chews, as I did for half the amount at the local pet store. Product shipped extremely quick even using the super saver shipping. My dog absolutely loves these treats. She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say ""bed"" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended. Oh and her breath is about half as stinky as it was before I started giving her these."
546,B0026RQTGE,4,Doggie Crack,"Dogs LOVE Greenies. We can't even say or spell the word without our three flipping out. Their daily Greenie is the high point of their day. Greenies work as advertised, keeping their teeth white and their breath smelling as good as a dog's breath can."
547,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"What can I say. To my dogs, giving them a Greenie is like giving them a steak! The minute they hear the box being take out of the closet they are right at my feet."
548,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great for my old, spoiled dog","My elderly (soon-to-be 17) beagle, Dakota, is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet."
549,B0026RQTGE,4,Dog loves them,"These are recommended by all vets that I've seen.  They are healthy, clean teeth and my dog loves them.  I cut them in half though as if he eats a whole (large) one, his tummy doesn't like it.  He has a VERY sensitive stomach though."
550,B0026RQTGE,1,WORMS IN GREENIES?????,This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.
551,B0026RQTGE,1,Observe Pet Reactions to Greenies,"I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an ""authorized vendor"".  ""Monster Pets"" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are ""authorized"".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an ""authorized"" vendor.  This now makes me leery of items purchased through ""Amazon Marketplace"", particularly food items.  Buyer beware!  Caveat emptor!"
552,B0026RQTGE,1,No go,"My dog won't eat these things. I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)"
553,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"My dog loves her greenies, she gets one every morning, if I forget to give her one she lets me know it in no uncertain terms.<br />I buy them from Amazon because the price is right, petsmart wants to much for them.<br />I just ordered them yesterday, received them today.<br /><br />Thanks"
554,B0026RQTGE,4,Just as pictured,"Nice to have a box to store the greenies, but the lid doesn't really fit back on once you open it, it's really flimsy plastic.  Inside is a ziploc bag of greenies."
555,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,"This product is just what we wanted. Doggie loves them,and I can hardly believe how fast they got here. Excellent seller.....Bunny"
556,B0026RQTGE,1,These scare me.  Look at what I've found online:,"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. ""They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.""  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  ""At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,""<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary."
557,B0026RQTGE,1,Worm found on Greenies Joint Care,"Just opened Greenies Joint Care (individually sealed) in December 2011 and found small worm crawling all over it.  Next one looked fine, but really supposed to trust these now?"
558,B0026RQTGE,2,Not too thrilled,"I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."
559,B0026RQTGE,1,puppy didn't like,"Bought the big box to be economical..bad choice. My dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another--and this was over months.  I gave them to a friend.  My friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these, so I'm not sad that my dog didn't like them."
560,B0026RQTGE,3,I don't recommend this treat for your dog.,"From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them."
561,B0026RQTGE,1,Very disappointed,"I ordered 3 packs of 27-count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale.  I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper."
562,B0026RQTGE,2,Good but GONE,"Supposed to be for cleaning their teeth - right...  well - that would assume they held up to some for of chewing...  our little Border TERRIER (not Collie) ""eats"" one of these in about 5 minutes...  too fast to be of any use to the teeth and almost too fast to cause concern in the digestive tract.  Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all."
563,B0026RQTGE,1,BEWARE,"I have bought greenies for my dog for 7 years (since she was a puppy). She has always had digestive problems, but we didn't know why. While googling greenies a couple of weeks ago, I found that several dogs have died because they were not able to digest greenies. Please do some research before buying this product again. It could save your dog's life. Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks)."
564,B0026RQTGE,3,Greenies,I thought the greenies were the petite size for small dogs instead they were much larger. I'm having to cut them in half for my 6# Yorkie.
565,B0026RQTGE,2,I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half,"I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up."
566,B0026RQTGE,1,Dog wont eat them,Had to buy another box of the same thing at Petsmart. She eats those.  Must not be fresh.  How can you tell when they look the same.
567,B0026RQTGE,2,Our dogs liked them OK...but!~,"Our dogs liked them OK...but!~....Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews....they are pricey and our two pooches love ....Veggi Dental Chews ...that's all we buy them now on Amazon of course!~"
568,B0026RQTGE,5,can't live without,"My dogs MUST HAVE a daily Greenie 1st thing in the morning.  If I run out, there is hell to pay. If they wake before me, they start licking my face so bad that I have to wash it!  I have 2 Maltese and they literally start dancing when I bring out the box. Last order I made a mistake and bought 6 boxes. So I should be set for a while.<br />27 ounce 96 count teenie tub pack<br /><br />I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN SELL USED GREENIES.  PLEASE EXPLAIN.<br /><br />I also purchased a Kindle.  I LOVE IT. I have optic neuritis from Multiple Sclerosis and I am now able to read by adjusting the font.<br />I am dissapointed  that the letters are wearing off and the covers are so expensive.  My cousin made me a beautiful one out of quilt. Much nicer than the $50+++ ones from Amazon. I TOLD HER SHE SHOULD SELL THEM."
569,B0026RQTGE,3,GREENIES are GREENIES!,"Dogs love them, this box was economical as compared to vet prices, BUT they by no means help my dog's bad breath.  I get stared down every night at ""TREAT TIME"" by my golden retrieve and sheltie, until I am forced to get out of my comfy chair and give them their EXPECTED DESSERT every single night.  As always, my dogs walk all over me! lol"
570,B0026RQTGE,1,DEADLY!!!!!,"I am writing this because this product KILLED my in-laws 2 year old YORKIE. They have been breeding Yorkies for 18 years and this was the first product they have used, that KILLED one of there dogs. They started using this product this past summer. Sweetie (the dog) was chewing on the GREENIE chew in front of both of them, when she started convulsing.  They immediately took her a 1/2 mile to the vet, by the time they arrived there, Sweetie was DEAD.  The Greenie had Pierced her TRACHEA.  Please be aware od how dangerous these could be to small dogs."
571,B0026RQTGE,1,do not feed this product to pugs.,My pug almost died from this product. A piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract. He had to have emergency surgery and 3000.00 later is now OK. Any knowledgeable pug breeder will tell you not to feed these to your pug. All the company did was refund me 25.00 for the cost of the product.
572,B0026RQTGE,1,Not the best,"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out."
573,B0026RQTGE,1,96=45,Just because you see 96 treats on the box your crazy if you think that's how many your buying everyone knows 96 really means 45
574,B0026RQTGE,3,My Dogs love them,My  dogs love them.. They are pricey for a treat tho!<br />I did not notice any change on their teeth -plaque stayed the same.. even tho I gave it to my  dog 2 times a day for few months. Still needed to go to the vet for  deep teeth cleaning.
575,B0026RQTGE,5,Yummy!!!,"My name is Duncan, and I'm a mommy's boy, and she and Dad love me so much that they give me one of these every day after supper.  They taste great and clean my teeth at the same time.  All my friends love them, too! They buy them from Amazon because the price is good.  I'm going to have them get on the automatic sending list, so I'll never run out!"
576,B0026RQTGE,1,Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick,"I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."
577,B0026RQTGE,1,Greenies Dental Chews For Dogs,"Consumers Beware of Greenie products for dogs or cats. It contains a very toxic ingriedant called, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite {MSB},which is a synthetic {man made} form of Vitamin K3 and causes cancer, organ damage {kidneys,lungs,liver,and mucous membranes}. It is also in almost All dry and canned pet foods. Chech your ingredients on All of your pet treats and foods. This will kill your pets. Check to see if BHA,BHT,and propylne glycol are listed in your treats and foods, both dry and canned. These Will Kill pets."
578,B0026RQTGE,1,Fatal,"Why aren't there more negative reviews on the site?  Greenies are known for the harm they've caused many dogs; just look it up to see for yourself.<br />Years ago, my Pomeranian died due to biting off a chunk of a Greenie bone and having it obstruct her intestine.<br />It was a painful and horrific death and I found out the same thing has happened to many other dogs to the fact that they are full of cellulose fiber.  There are many other types of teeth-cleaning bones out there that WON'T seriously injure your dogs.  They're probably cheaper as well."
579,B0026RQTGE,1,My dog won't eat them,"Bought these for my little shih-tzu a few months ago and he just will not eat or even chew on these things. And he's a chewer! Chews on everything else in the house, anyway. I tried coating it in peanut butter and he ate the first one, but the next time I tried he knew I was trying to trick him and wouldn't go near it."
580,B0026RQTGE,3,Best price...,"I'm not sure how much I like this product because I'm always a little concerned our puppies might choke on the Greenies which tend to be a bit small.  When it comes to oral hygiene, I actually prefer the CET chews:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P3PR54"">C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Petite Dogs, 30 Chews</a>.  Having said that, if you already know you like Greenies, this seems to be the best price anywhere..."
581,B0026RQTGE,1,Be careful with wheat gluten,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."
582,B0026RQTGE,1,Find another treat,"I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product. Your best friend deserves it."
583,B0026RQTGE,3,NOT LONG LASTING,"I bought two of these at a pet store. One for 100lb plus dogs. My lab is 45 lbs. She consumed it in minutes.<br />I also got a small one for my older chihuahua mix, she consumed it within minutes.<br />Long lasting they are not !<br /><br />Bull sticks are the only item I have found that last a while. However they smell bad. Even the so called orderless ones."
584,B0026RQTGE,1,Greenies Made My Dog SICK,"Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!"
585,B0026RQTGE,2,wrong size,I ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs.  My dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size.
586,B0026RQTGE,1,Didn't receive what I ordered,I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.
587,B0026RQTGE,1,PLEASE RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING TO YOUR DOG!,"Read the stories online....dogs have died from Greenies.  I gave my 50lb pound dog Greenies for the first time 2 weeks ago, and she became very very sick for more than a week.  She was vomiting and having potty issues the entire time.  These cause blockages and do not allow the dog to fully digest.  I can't believe these are still on the market.<br /><br />From one loving pet owner to another - DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING YOUR DOGS GREENIES!  TRUST ME."
588,B0026RQTGE,2,less than I ordered,"The ad says 30 regular greenies, but the package I received says<br />27 greenies."
589,B0026RQTGE,1,"The Ultimate Consumer ""Fraud.""","We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price."
590,B0026RQTGE,3,Greenies,I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.  They were too big for my cat.
591,B0026RQTGE,3,Greenies never has clear description,"hello,<br /><br />i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size ""petite"". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no ""e"" at the end?!<br /><br />thanks"
592,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love these,"The thing I like about the senior Greenies is that they seem a little bit softer than regular Greenies, so they are easier on my dogs' teeth (I have 6 dogs, 5 seniors and only my 9-toothed senior Doxie doesn't eat them)."
593,B0026RQTGE,4,My dogs love these,I have five dogs and feed these daily to help keep their teeth clean.  My only complaint is that they are quite expensive to feed on a daily basis.  Wish there was a way to buy them in bulk.
594,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great treat for dogs, plus ""lite""",These are great for small dogs. I have two dachshunds and I love that these are lower in calories. I cut them in half because they get more than one per day. They like them as much as the regular ones.
595,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies are the Best,"My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies."
596,B0026RQTGE,3,"Large size is ""small""",While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size)<br />My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price.<br />I'll be trying other brands.
597,B0026RQTGE,4,Hate to pay the price,"This appeared to be the best price around, but I still don't like paying it!  Wish my dog would eat pigs ears, but he has to have his ""toothbrush"".  My vet also sells these and I do trust him, so maybe ""Max"" knows best."
598,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs LOVE these,"I have two Chihuahua/Yorkie females (age 5, both 7 pounds) and they absolutely love these -- it helps their breath smell better too.  It's a win-win situation!  I give them each one a day.  Amazon's price of $22.95 for 96 beats the price at my local pet store by a full ten dollars!"
599,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenie is my dog's other name,"The fur kid loves these & vet has commented on how clean her teeth are for a seven year old.  They're pricey, but for a once a day treat I think they're worth it for keeping her teeth in good condition, not to mention seeing her big grin when we open the container.  We should've named her ""Greenie"" because that one word gets her attention like nothing else will."
600,B0026RQTGE,5,Great product and free shipping to AK.  Can't beat that!,"I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them."
601,B0026RQTGE,4,Good stuff,"Dog loves these - and he's about an 85 lb chow/german mix, so the large size is good for him.  I guess these are good and healthy for dogs - supposedly they are - but they're also pretty expensive.  These are also chewy - so it only takes him about 1-minute to devour - so you may want to take that into consideration if you're looking for something that will last a little longer . . ."
602,B0026RQTGE,2,keeps breath fresh but gives diarrhea,"I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews."
603,B0026RQTGE,4,Great Deal???,Purchased for a good price.  My Chihuahua likes them. Did a subscription and received tub for $16.92. However a week later went on line to find the subscription price had gone up to $20.99 and no notification was sent to inform me of price increase.
604,B0026RQTGE,5,My dog loves these.,"After having 11 teeth pulled by the Vet, I had to find a convenient way to brush my dogs teeth.  I have used these for 6 months and he has not had any more teeth problems.  he loves the taste and he has fresh breath."
605,B0026RQTGE,3,Dog likes it,"These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry."
606,B0026RQTGE,5,"Greenies Dental Chews for,Teenie","I have a little Shi-Tzu...Every day at 3:oopm she gets a greenie.She never forget,She stare at me with her lazer eyes until I go to the package and give one greenie. She loves your product and cannot live without it."
607,B0026RQTGE,5,Dog Loves Greenies,My dog loves the Greenies and they actually do work for him as his teeth are whiter and breath is fresher.  I have tried other brands and had to come back to the Greenies!
608,B0026RQTGE,4,Our dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie,"I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention ""Greenie"".  I do wish Greenies were a little harder.  The dogs polish them off so quickly that I don't think they really are helping clean the teeth very well."
609,B0026RQTGE,3,Greenies,"My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean.<br />she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two."
610,B0026RQTGE,5,Good deal,The dental chews were the right size for my golden retrievers.  They love them.  The chews arrived promptly and in good condition.
611,B0026RQTGE,4,My dogs love Greenies!,"My dogs get one greenie everyday.  I like that they offer a lite version.  I was giving them the teenie version that has 96 greenies which took less than 1 minute to consume.  Since they are 14 lbs and 19 lbs, I'm happy that they offer the petite size which takes them a couple minutes to consume."
612,B0026RQTGE,4,favorite treat!,"Bentley LOVES Greenies!  He has a lot of tartar and he is only 2 1/2 so we use them hoping it helps.  He gets one every night if he has finished all his food.  He will go to the closet and cry if I forget.  All I have to say is ""puppy crack""  and he goes crazy for it!  It seems to be helping, but I can't really tell but we will continue using it always.  I priced them several places and Amazon was the best deal."
613,B0026RQTGE,5,My pooch's absolute favorite chew treat!!,"All my dogs have absolutely loved Greenies, though my latest little guy tends to gain weight in the winter, hence Greenies Lite!  This is the treat that my dogs will literally DANCE for, so when I can find these tubs for a great price, I grab them!  They really do prevent stinky breath and keep his six-year old doggy teeth looking good.  This was a ""home-run"" hit under the Christmas tree!"
614,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs go crazy for these,"Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies."
615,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Deal,"My dogs go crazy for these! It really does help w their bad breath, and it keeps them busy for a little bit."
616,B0026RQTGE,5,Dogs Love Them,"great value, arrived quickly.  My two dogs love these treats and they are great for their teeth. Another great purchase"
617,B0026RQTGE,5,amazing value price.,"I have 2 small dogs, that absolutely love greenies, In stores such as pets mart or pet co they want $35+ on sale for a pack this large. I always order on amazon. who doesn't want to spoil their dogs at a great price while keeping their teeth white and gums healthy."
618,B0026RQTGE,4,dog likes them,"my dog loves her greenies, and it is better to buy them in a tub-pak because you get more for your money"
619,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great treat, dog loves them!","My Black Lab loves these treats, I need to keep them on hand so I buy two boxes at a time. The ziplock bag closure keeps the treats fresh and keeps the pantry from smelling like greenies (nice for the dog, not for us). This also appears to be the best pricing."
620,B0026RQTGE,5,My dogs love them and they really work!,My two dogs love them. All I have to say is it's greenie time. I have checked their teeth and they have improved so much. My vet recommended them and I'm glad that I bought them. Amazon delivery was fantasticly fast!
621,B0026RQTGE,5,Great treat for you dog while improving their tooth health,"Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.  I'd always thought they were a bit expensive but Amazon has brought them to us at a more affordable price.  We have chosen the lite variety to keep our lab a bit trimmer in weight.  A good product at a reasonable price....Thanks"
622,B0026RQTGE,5,Yorkies love em,This is a great product. My dogs love them. In fact they will fight over who gets one first. The teenies are the perfect size. It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.<br /><br />My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small brushes to brush their teeth.
623,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies for My Dogs,"I recently found Greenies at Amazon. My dogs love them and I found them cheaper on Amazon than I can get them locally.They are a treat that, also, keeps their teeth cleaner and their breath smells good. When my dogs are happy, I'm happy and with Amazon's price, my wallet is happy!!!!!"
624,B0026RQTGE,5,Great gift for your favorite small dog!,"I purchased these for my 19 lb beagle.  They actually came in a holiday box (I didn't know this until I opened my amazon box), which would've been great had I been giving them as a gift.  They are the perfect size for my dog, and she devours them!  Note:  It is recommended that you give your dog only one treat per day."
625,B0026RQTGE,5,Good price and fast shipping,"I am happy with the service of this company.  Fast shipping and great communication.  Also, the product helps keep my dogs teeth clean and breath smelling great.  My dog gets Greenies every night and reminds me at 8 PM that it is time for Greenies."
626,B0026RQTGE,5,Wonder where the tartar went.............,"I was a skeptic.  I thought I would have to have my dogs teeth cleaned by a vet at a cost of $150.00 plus.  Their breath would knock over a horse.  Then I heard of Greenies!  Wow can I say, bright teeth and great breath and I feed them only 1/2 of a regular one a day.  They love them! Great product, fast shipping, there is nothing more that needs to be said."
627,B0026RQTGE,5,Great Bundle will last forever for small dog.,Make sure you have a small dog...Big Dogs might choke on these if they get to anxious...  But there are a ton in this box - a great value and they do whiten the teeth very well - see all the great reviews.  Help your dogs teeth if you don't want to brush them like me.
628,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies,These are the best things since sliced bread.  I have been giving my dogs this treat for quite awhile.  My dogs love them and they were very reasonably priced.  I paid you $18.95 plus shipping and at Petsmart they are $32.99 plus tax for the exact same amount.  Thanks for the good buy.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Danny Knowles
629,B0026RQTGE,5,my dog loves these,My dog loves these.  I received a sample at the vet's office where I got my puppy and he loved them.  I like the fact that they help to clean his teeth as well as satisfy his need to chew.
630,B0026RQTGE,5,Greenies Dental Chews -Teenies,"Oh my gosh, we cannot be without Greenies at our house or I will have a very unhappy doggie.  She seems to know the exact time of day that she will get her greenie, and just wags and begs for it right after dinner.  I order from Amazon because the price is the best I have found and the delivery is fast and convenient.<br />I am a huge fan of Amazon, they treat their customers right and makes all purchases/returns very easy."
631,B0026RQTGE,5,"Great product, great price","Same thing you buy for a lot more at other stores. Not much more to say about.  I love it, she loves it, and I've bought it again numerous times."
632,B003B3OOPA,5,"Taste good, great with honey!","Coconut Oil is so tasty, it goes great with anything sweet. I use it on a piece of bread with honey, so good. It is also good for Asian style sweet dishes, gives an excellent flavor. If you using it as a dietary supplement by taking a tablespoon; it can be quite difficulty to swallow because of the texture. One thing about this oil is it doesn't refrigerate well and at 76 Fahrenheit it melts completely."
633,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome Stuff !!,"This was my first time to try coconut oil, other than using the red kind for popcorn. [which works great in a Stir Crazy] I will be repeating what many have said, but just to add my thoughts....I hope Amazon stocks this FOREVER !!  Smells lovely, like coconut, reminds me of the beach. At room temperature, it is solid....and if I have one tiny complaint, it can be a little difficult to spoon out of the jar. I don't want to soften/melt it each time I need a teaspoonful, so I struggle a bit and scoop it out.<br /><br />  On toast or English muffins, you can use it just like butter, but it seems to have a much more pleasant taste, and leaves the bread more crispy, {never soggy like butter can sometimes pool on toast in little patches.} To use making scrambled eggs or an omelet, it's easy to use, just like any oil, and adds no real discernible taste to me. It's great to just take some and rub on your skin, you then smell wonderful, and it soaks right in....leaving your skin smooth and silky. I have dry skin, and using this coconut oil or almond oil is something that has changed my life....tossing out all the ""off the shelf"" lotions that never really helped.<br /><br />  Only time will tell if all the health benefits pan out for me. But I enjoy using this instead of butter, and plan to continue to do so. The price is great here on Amazon, especially on Subscribe and Save. It was delivered quickly, although it was just tossed into a large box, and allowed to roll around in transit, which I thought was strange packaging. But it was undamaged, and still solid, no evidence of leakage in the box.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try healthier oils, and anyone with dry skin. I read online that this can be mixed with garlic oil and Vit. E liquid to make a healing ointment. There is a lot of info online regarding the positives of coconut oil, and Dr. Oz recommends it, for what that is worth to you."
634,B003B3OOPA,5,Gotta Love Amazon,"This product is simply amazing. It is a much better value on Amazon than anywhere else I have seen. I recently went to an over-priced ""Parisian"" hair salon to get a keratin treatment and it left my long, natural hair severely damaged, breaking, and feeling like straw. Yes, I am still miffed. My sister insisted that I ditch all the expensive treatments and commercial products and just let my hair go natural and treat it with coconut oil which she uses on her gorgeous, long, black tresses. In desperation, I ordered several bottles. They came surprisingly fast and I immediately tore open the box and after inhaling the euphoric aroma for a half a minute, I slathered it on my hair and scalp and left it on all day (while indoors). After I washed it off, my hair was visibly silkier, shinier, and had much less breakage. I'm in love! Also, I use it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin supple with a slight smell of coconut. Love the price, love the product. Can't go wrong."
635,B003B3OOPA,5,The best on the market!!!,"I am a biracial man.Now,that means i have Indian,African,Caucasus in me.Now i have really dry hair with many split ends and hair loss.This coconut oil has bring my hair back to normal as it should has been.I rub apple cider vinger on my scalp before i was my hair.I rub the coconut oil through my hair also.Put coconut oil in a cup and let it warm by a heater so i will feel like hot oil.Do not heat your oil up on a stove or in a microwave.Let the oil and vinger set in your hair for an hour than wash it out.Shampoo i used Henna shampoo and psoriasis shampoo from Justnatural.com.If you are African and you want to stop using them chemical perms or straightener combs i recommend you start using this.This will and i guarantee straighten your hair out and give it the real nutrients that your hair needs.Try it and you will not turn back!The best oil on the market!"
636,B003B3OOPA,5,Creamiest brand ever,"I have tried a few different extra virgin coconut oil products in the past (Vitamin shoppe brand, parachute,etc) and they tend to have a grainy texture to them. Not a major problem, but who wants to pick shredded coconut out of their hair? This brand was so silky, smooth, and smelled wonderful. I think I found my favorite brand of EVCO!"
637,B003B3OOPA,5,AMAZING,"I love this stuff.  I use it on my skin and it drinks it up.  I put it in my hair before washing, and my hair looks great and hydrated.  I really like this stuff.  I moisturize my face with it at night as well.  It's really an amazing product.  Bravo and I'm so happy I bought this :)"
638,B003B3OOPA,5,Very good,"I've bought both this brand and the Nutiva, and to be honest there's no real discernible difference. Both are good products. I do like the see through container this one has though a bit better since you can see exactly how much you have left a little easier. I use the oil for my GI tract since I have several issues with it and have difficulty with handling and absorbing fats. I try to eat at least a tblsp a day, usually spread on toast, it's excellent as a spread. I use it in baking in place of butter and other oils and sometimes for cooking too."
639,B003B3OOPA,5,"Great product, very mild scent","I love this product. The scent isn't overpowering. We have been using this for many things such as the treatment of diaper rash, hand moisturizer, and even in the bedroom. I love how it melts to the touch. Will definitely buy again."
640,B003B3OOPA,5,"What ""Extra Virgin"" label  mean for coconut ?????","If the label say ""Cold Pressed"" and ""Organic"", it would make more sense to me than saying ""Extra Virgin""  blah blah blah because this ""Extra Virgin"" theme is borrowed from the olive oil) and which does not make any sense for coconut. The ""Extra Virgin"" label is just for marketing purpose and to make the product itself more appealing to buyer.<br />I have no way to verify if this coconut oil is truly organic or cold pressed, since I wasn't in Philippine at the time they made it, but<br />I hope they are honest.<br /><br />Anyway,<br />I like the taste of this oil, I mix it with peanut butter, and I wish if I can find a coconut oil with a stronger coconut taste. For me the coconut taste is not strong enough. I tried different brand from amazon, and all has the same taste. I tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a> and has the same taste as this one, except this Nature's oil brand is sometime cheaper<br />I like it, and will keep doing so as long as they offer it at a competitive price."
641,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!!,"I love this oil, it smells great and it tastes great.  I use this oil for EVERYTHING!!  I cook with it, I wash my face with it, I use it as an oil treatment in my hair, I put it all over my body and it has cured my eczema!  I really like this brand, I think it has the best flavor and the price is really good."
642,B003B3OOPA,5,Finally!!! Amazing result!!!,"After years and years of suffering, long vet office visits, tons of money on vet bills, applying gallons of meds prescribed, my dogs still had itchy bleeding ear infections until Coconut Oil. I had recently heard of health benefits of coconut oil, in particular of anti bacterial aspect, I gave it a try.<br /><br />After about 1 week, both of my dog's ear infections are almost completely gone!!! with NO bad side effects. I now feed them about a teaspoon of coconut oil for their overall health."
643,B003B3OOPA,5,Wow!! Amazing stuff,"I've been using this coconut oil every chance I get. It does wonderful things for my hair, and skin (conditions, moisturizes it without any buildup). I'm in the process of transiting from my chemically treated hair and was informed that pure coconut oil is great for natural hair, and wow I am impressed. It's a very light oil, unlike olive oil, which is great, but thicker and heavier.  I haven't used it in my food yet.  Also there is not a coconut scent to it, and it does not really have a taste to it."
644,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,The Nature's Way coconut oil has done wonders for my hair. I leave it on for two hours before washing and it really does the job of moisturizing my hair.
645,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I just love this stuff. I'm still trying it out, but so farit's great, very versitile. I use it in my hair, on my face, as a lotion and take 1 tbls everyday by mouth. i have yet to cook with it.  But so far so good."
646,B003B3OOPA,5,Re: superior coconut oil!,"I have tried numerous coconut oils, but this product is by far, the best for the price."
647,B003B3OOPA,5,yummy!,I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  It smells like a macaroon<br />and is great for moisturizing and cooking.  I made chicken with it and it was delicious.
648,B003B3OOPA,5,Fantastic!,"I love this stuff. I use it to keep my skin soft and smooth. It smells incredible. It doesn't leave an icky residue on my skin like other skin softeners do. It has a wonderful, subtle flavor."
649,B003B3OOPA,5,The Best stuff YET!,"Edit Below<br />I got this on sale and am new to this. I have been reading about the uses and was ready to try it.  The first thing I did was try it on my hair. I can't remember if I left a review on the other Coconut oil I bought but I have hair past my waist and I was in my pool on a hot day and when I finally got out I was exhausted.  I wanted to rest before I showered and passed out. I went to sleep with all of that chlorine in my hair and my hair was a dull, brittle feeling. I had just received the oil 2 days before. So I rubbed it through my hair. My hair seemed to be bright and soft. It even looked a little more blond. I have been cutting up veggies and spraying the oil on them while cooking. I bought the ""Misto"" and filled it with the Coconut oil. But the best thing so far...Is toast with the oil on it. There are so many benefits of the Oil and it is delicious.<br />***Here is the EDIT***9-5-12<br />I found a new delicious way to use this. You know the Olive oil bread dipping with garlic? Well, I made spaghetti and I put my seasonings and started to put my olive oil in my round dishes and right then I stopped. I put 2 tbsp of EVOO and 3 tbsp of Coconut oil the grated the garlic and added my Parmesan cheese. OMG, it was so wonderful.<br />Thanks to all of you who inspired me to start using this stuff."
650,B003B3OOPA,5,Tons of Uses!!,"I decided to try this coconut oil after reading tons of blogs about all the different uses it has, and I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />My daughter has a pretty bad case of Keratosis Pilaris on both of her arms, and also her cheeks. I've tried numerous products on her to try to remove the little bumps, but nothing had worked. Almost immediately after applying a very thin layer of coconut oil on her skin, there was an amazing improvement! The bumps lessened, and after a week they had completely disappeared! After seeing these results, I had my son use it, who has eczema on his hands.... and again, the eczema cleared up almost immediately.<br /><br />I personally use the coconut oil on my hands to moisturize them, and also put a tablespoon of the stuff in my coffee every morning to help with my metabolism as I have thyroid issues."
651,B003B3OOPA,5,Cure for Cancer???,"I know my title is a bit much, but this oil is seriously multi-purposed and it's that great. I use this brand on my daughter's skin from around 5mths to now 11mths. She had severe Ezcema and it kept recuring whenever she got hot. her skin in exactly like a baby's skin should be - soft and smooth since I started using it. Plus I'm always smelling her bc she smells so yummy. OFF TOPIC: I also give her lots of pure coconut water and she loves it<br />For me, I spread it on my toast, sprinkle on my salads, saute with it - scrambled eggs are THE BEST when fried with this. I even put a few teaspoons in my hot choclate (yummy). It's the best for retaining moisture in your hair so I also use as a hot oil treatment before bed and wash off next day. I let my hair air dry and it's the softest its been in years. I lather with is right after my shower and wake up with soft supple skin. I keep one in the bathroom, another in the Kitchen and one in my daughter's room. I will NEVER be without this super product.<br />Oh and my mom swears by it too as it's helped control her blood sugar (she's a diabetic) Her Doc is so impressed he took her off Metformin."
652,B003B3OOPA,5,Feet Action,I put just a dab of coconut oil on my feet and my feet became soft instantly. I love this product. so many different usages.
653,B003B3OOPA,5,A Hair Miracle!,"I've been natural for almost a year now and its hard to find a product that could really add moisture to my hair while killing my dandruff problem.  I was hesitate at first after seeing a friend use it on his hair (He's Spanish so it works with different hair types)I thought his hair took well to the product because of the completely different texture, but I tried it anyway.<br /><br />I must say my hair absolutely loves this stuff. It not only moisturizer my hair but it makes it really soft and manageable. It also gives my hair shine, body, and luster. Although, I have flakes here and there the amount of dandruff has decreased dramatically, when I use the product consistently.I have even given it a test run by allowing my hair to go without it for about a week. I only used regular conditioner on my hair. The results were terrible. My hair became dried and rough. It lost the luster and shine and it was no longer silky to the touch.<br /><br />This product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone with any hair type."
654,B003B3OOPA,5,Great all around!,"I use this soooo much, I have it on auto order!  I give a spoonful to my dog a day and it keeps his coat shiny, his breath fresh, and he LOVES IT!  For me I put it on my curly hair to tame the frizz, on my skin as a moisturizer, and I take 2tbs a day as a weight loss supplement...you can't go wrong with this product.  It tastes great and I don't even like coconut, amazing to scramble eggs with though!"
655,B003B3OOPA,5,Read this if you have keratosis piliarisis!!!,"This gets rid of your KP! I have a bad case of KP ever since I was younger. It is so embarrassing and people always asked what was wrong with the skin on my upper arms.<br /><br />I was willing to try anything because nothing, no cream, no scrub has gotten rid of it until I tried coconut oil. I wish I could tell the world about how this has been miracle for me.<br /><br />Trust me just buy it :)"
656,B003B3OOPA,4,Excellent coconut oil,"This was less expensive than purchasing at the local grocer and there are a million uses for coconut oil! I use it as hair oil, body, face moisturizer, furniture polish, supplement to my tea, I even tried oil pulling with it. Great product!"
657,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this stuff!,"Unlike the medical establishment, I have come to believe that fats in general are NOT harmful OR fattening!  There are so many different types if fat, they should not all be lumped together.  Avoid the long chain saturated fats (animal fats), but short chain saturated fats (like butter, palm, and coconut) are fine.<br /><br />I love cooking my morning eggs in this oil.  They stick WAY less than cooked in butter or olive oil.  Yes, it imparts a VERY MILD coconut taste to whatever you cook in it.  I don't mind, and have come to like it.  It was different the first few times, tho.  I also recommend you get an aluminum anodized (ceramic non-stick) pan.  Yes, I know they still contain teflon...doesn't bother me (the anodize coating is porous, and the pores are filled with teflon).  The anodized aluminum is so much more durable you will love it!<br /><br />Satisfied customer...great product...great price...I'll be buying regularly!"
658,B003B3OOPA,5,Best Oil Ever,"I put this on my feet at night, my face as a moisturizer and put a little in my protein shakes. Excellent product and see the benefits already after a couple of weeks using it. Haven't cooked with it yet but judging by the smell of it, I will try in the near future."
659,B003B3OOPA,4,Great for cooking and spread.,"I have been enjoying this product as a spread for waffles in the morning (with a little cinnamon) and for cooking fish and other stir fry dishes.  Makes for a nice change from olive oil and it has a lovely flavor and scent.  I also use it on my lips when a I need a quick moisturizer.  This product does change very quickly from solid to liquid when it is warmed.  That is great for cooking, but when using it as a spread, it can be messy.  The fridge can make it too hard and leaving it on the counter in the summer will turn it to oil. I have not found the happy medium yet, but I like the product so I will continue to use it."
660,B003B3OOPA,5,Great stuff!,This is the first coconut oil I've used and so far I love it. It moisturizes my 40-something skin very well! It also leaves my lips so soft! Will definitely purchase this product again.
661,B003B3OOPA,5,great to have,"i'm so glad I figured out the secret of coconut oil. My fav way to use it is for lotion. After I shave my legs and I put this stuff on it helps my legs stay so smooth and soft. My hair does not grow back so prickly. I also love how when I go into the ocean after I shave my legs it does not burn anymore! I also use this for baking food. My food comes out more moist, especially cakes. There are so many good health reasons to use coconut oil. For skin and for eating. wow I love multi tasking:)"
662,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome conditioner for thick African American hair!,"This coconut oil works wonders for my hair! I'm transitioning from using over the counter products with more natural alternatives and I truly am pleased. After about a month of using it as an overnight prepoo and after wash sealer I have noticed a change for the better in my hair. Coconut oil is the only oil that can penetrate into your hair follicles. My hair holds moisture a lot better than ever before, is stronger, shinier, smoother and softer. It makes a great hot oil treatment in tandem with amla oil. The smell isn't strong - it has a light nutty coco butter scent.<br /><br />Also, I found using this with shea butter liquifies it easier when rubbing your palms together. I've only used this product on my hair but I would love to try it with cooking."
663,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing stuff,"Ive been getting different brands of coconut oil for a few years, more recently the big tub from Jarrow. I cook with it almost every day and take spoon fulls of it as well..I decided to try this brand based on the trusty reviews here on amazon and I am amazed..This stuff is simply delicious. Im surprised how different it is from Jarrow..It definitely has that more natural taste that the reviews here said. I will never get another brand of coconut oil."
664,B003B3OOPA,5,"Excellent for skin, hair, and cooking","I bought this primarily to use on my hair after using coconut oil in small bottles that I would have to microwave before use because they were solid. This oil is easy to scoop out and it melts in your hands so doesn't need to be continually microwaved. I ran out of anti-wrinkle cream, so I decided to put this oil of my face instead, and it makes it very soft and supple and hopefully it will keep the wrinkles at bay as well. On a whim, I decided to use some while frying rice and it came out absolutely delicious. It gives a hint of coconut flavor to dishes cooked in it. I'm ordering another jar because I don't want to cook with something I'm scooping out to use on my face and hair.  I will be ordering many more jars."
665,B003B3OOPA,5,Very healthy,"Very good quality unrefined coconut oil.  I coom with this and used it to mix with shea butter when i was pregnant for preventing stretch marks and itching and it worked great.  I use it for my baby's ezema now too, its greasy on the skin but soaks in quickly.  When cooking I use it in place of butter and olive oil and it has actually helped with my weight loss and my husbands, of course you have to eat healthy too but it made a noticeable difference in a two week period of time."
666,B003B3OOPA,5,One of the Best Coconut oils on the Market,"We enjoyed our first 2 jars and use it for cooking an average of 2 times a day. Storage ok so far with our<br />house temp under 76 degrees. During the summer will have to refrigerate it to keep it solid. Great flavor with all meats-beef, fish, chicken; adding to oatmeal.  Too bad the prices are going up everywhere including this product on all Coconut oils sold.  This is the best price for this brand so far.  Will continue to use it unless the price keeps going up."
667,B003B3OOPA,5,Pure and tasty CoconutOil from Amazon,"Mild but definite Coconut flavor here. I use instead of butter on toast, vegies, rice, cakes, etc. Not good for frying, except eggs. No crispy browning. Contains medium chain amino acids that works wonders on brain neuron connections for Alshiemers and weaned  babies. Lack of these, may even be a factor in causing Autism. Olive, and other oils have none. Non-hydrogenated!"
668,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing Skin and Hair Softener!,"I use this coconut oil as both a skin oil and a deep conditioner for my hair. It gives me a lovely coconut fragrance, and my skin and hair haven't been this soft in years! I am also going to go out and get a small container so I can carry a bit around in my purse for chapstick. No more dry lips for me! I highly recommend this product to anyone (Well, unless you hate coconut. Then you might not be such a fan of the smell. It is pretty subtle, however, and reminds me of summer :D )."
669,B003B3OOPA,5,The smell of sunshine and ice-cream!,"I thought I hated coconut oil, because I bought the cheap, processed Louanna coconut oil from Wally World. It is still sitting in the cupboard with only one use. Later, I read an article and found that to get the benefits of coconut oil you need it unrefined. When I opened the lid the smell of coconut assured me that this oil was the real thing--I love this stuff! I've used it so many different ways; my favourite ways to use are as a sugar scrub or as a deodorant--melt a few tablespoons of oil, put in 1/8 cup baking soda and cornstarch, and a couple drops of tea tree oil."
670,B003B3OOPA,5,Good product,I recently read that coconut oil can be helpful with dementia so I looked for an easy source (as a hopeful preventative!).  This is a very nice product and gives good instructions for using it for cooking and also as a hair treatment.  I certainly recommend it.  And they have a web address on the jar for answering questions.  I contacted them with a question about allergens and they responded quickly.
671,B003B3OOPA,4,Delicious and a world of uses!,"Before I get rambling, I have to say this stuff smells FANTASTIC, Crazy or not, occasionally I'll just open the jar and take a nice inhale.<br /><br />I bought this for two reasons, 1 my dog and I have been fighting the ups and downs of skin treatments for years. Antibiotics, skin creams, food changes, special shampoos, ugh you name it, I've put more money onto my dogs rear end then I have ever spent on myself, and to top it off all his skin issues make him smelly! I read online that coconut oil helps solve a multitude of issues inside and out, and since it's something all natural, I feel better about using it in general.<br /><br />I put it directly onto his legs and lower back just today, the fragrant coconut oil really helps with cutting back on how smelly he is, He seems less restless with his itchy spots - but only time will really tell if this stuff is really going to make any progress for him.<br /><br />The other reason I purchased this was because I wanted to make my own handmade soap, and it worked just fine for that use!"
672,B003B3OOPA,5,Tastes great and good for you,Coconut oil is so good for you and tasty. It contains 62% MCT (medium chain triglycerides) which is a type of fat that actually helps you burn MORE fat. Easy to cook with and make delicious smoothies with too.
673,B003B3OOPA,5,Absolutely great!!,"I LOVE the organic coconut oil by Nature's Way.  It is the best moisturizer for my face and hair (I have tried almond, shea and grapeseed too), and not to mention, it feels so smooth, creamy and totally awesome on my hands, fingertips and feet.  Also, this is totally natural and cold pressed.  What more can you ask for?  No bad odors either (unlike shea oil)!  I have used the Nutiva organic coconut oil too, and Nature Way just feels a lot better and totally awesome on my hands.  I cannot comment as far as cooking is concerned, because I go through these jars very fast just using them for hair and skincare and scalp message.  I use this and pure almond oil alternatively on my eyelids and under eyes.  Try it by all means, if you are thinking about it."
674,B003B3OOPA,5,Delightful taste!,"I'm just starting out with coconut oil, and after trying this product,well, I'm a now believer.  I wasn't sure what I'd gotten myself into when I first tried a spoonful.  The texture reminded me a bit of crisco (uh!), but it immediately started to warm on my tongue and there was a heavenly, light coconut aftertaste that reminded me a bit of an almond joy bar (without the almond or chocolate).  I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking. It's wonderful for moisturizing after a shower, or for using right before bed when the coconut scent is restful. This is my favorite brand, and I'm sticking to it."
675,B003B3OOPA,5,Great stuff!,"I use this coconut oil on my hair as a sealant after I moisturize my hair, and I also mix it into my conditioners and oils. I absolutely adore this product! My hair smells absolutely amazing and feels just as good! I recommend buying this, because the results are nothing short of amazing! My hair has never been so soft and smelt so good before!"
676,B003B3OOPA,5,Yum!,"I was surprised how large the tub actually was. The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not ""ruin"" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again."
677,B003B3OOPA,5,"High quality, low cost product","My sister introduced me to coconut oil and although she was weary about me using it as face lotion I showed her that it helped me A LOT with my dry skin and did not cause acne. Normally I have really dry skin on my nose at forehead to the extent that it would start peeling off in the middle of the day... and no lotions would work! :( Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin fairly normal in this regard -- especially with the dry, harsh winters of IL. Any coconut oil would do, but this one is low cost, high quality, has fast shipping. Basically, once this jar runs out, I'm ordering it again."
678,B003B3OOPA,5,I just got mine and I am so excited!,"It smelled great in the jar. I used it immediately on my pregnant belly, thighs, eyes, and a dry patch under my mouth. I also heated up a tiny bit (a little goes a long way) in the microwave to apply to my hair and ends to freshen up my 3rd day flexi rod set. I can just tell this is my new beauty staple! My cat tried to eat some too and that just goes to show because my smart fat kitty would never try to eat any hair product, but he knew this baby was naturally edible lol."
679,B003B3OOPA,5,Cleared up my skin!!,"This coconut oil has truly been my little miracle product. I have Keratosis Pilaris and I have tried different products for years trying to get rid of it or improve it even a little, to no avail. I have tried countless lotions, including KP Duty. About a month ago I stumbled upon an article of someone claiming coconut oil cleared up her keratosis, I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot. I have been applying coconut oil to my skin every time I take a shower and also mixing in about 1/2 a tablespoon with my dinner for about a month now.  I also added a daily multivitamin into my diet. The progress was slow but now all of a sudden my skin has shown incredible improvement. I would say my keratosis has cleared up as much as 75%!  I am shocked and very happy.  Such a cheap alternative to all the expensive lotions too!! I will continue to use Coconut Oil for life."
680,B003B3OOPA,5,So yummy!,I bought this as a suggestion for my very dry and very sensitive skin. I absolutely love it. I used it for the first time and my skin is already 80% better!  It doesn't leave you overly oily either. It smells so yummy as well. Very happy overall!
681,B003B3OOPA,5,This stuff is the truth,"Coconut oil. My staple product for hair ,supplements, body lotion. This stuff has my hair growing like wild fire. It works great smell awesome and its the best body oil. My number one thing is coconut oil. Try it."
682,B003B3OOPA,5,Love It,This stuff is so great. It smells wonderful and melts like butter in your hands. I love its many different uses. I love it on my hair and skin and soon ill try some of it in my food.
683,B003B3OOPA,5,Interesting Oil,"This is a very unique oil, you can use it in your hair as a hot oil treatment, use it to soothe pain on an infected area on the skin, you can use it when cooking. I like the solid form of this product. No spills, melt what you need. Nice fragrance too."
684,B003B3OOPA,5,"Love, love, love it","I use it on my skin, but it is eatable.  It melts right away when you spread it on your skin and it smells sooo good."
685,B003B3OOPA,5,Great,I received this item within a week and I am stationed overseas. I use it on my skin and it makes it soooo soft.
686,B003B3OOPA,5,Makes everything taste good...,"You can a little of this with just about anything you bake.  I add this to my baked banana bread and it's great.  I've used it on my hair also, I remember using pure coconut oil when I was a little girl in my home country as a conditioner and hair softener.  This is a good price as I've seen it for a lot more in our local stores."
687,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent,"I am from the Philippines, so I am familiar with the smell of fresh coconut oil. I have tried various so-called virgin coconut oils before, but they smelled so rancid within one week of opening, that at one point I resorted to rendering my own coconut oil, but that was so time-consuming and tedious. Some other brands were masked by additional scent. For a while I was discouraged from trying any coconut oil, until I read reviews on this one. I tried one, and I was hooked. It smelled so HEAVENLY like the fresh coconut that I remember. Every time I would apply on my skin or hair, I would be reminded of our rice-based coconut desserts, so for purposes of having a dose of 1-2 tbsp per day, it was also not hard for me to take it plain, although the lack of sweetness quickly brings me back to the reality that it was not coconut-y dessert I was eating, but that's easily solved by adding muscovado or brown sugar. This is certainly the best coconut oil I have had so far, and the ONLY one I have tried and actually finished (I used to stop using those previous ones when I could no longer stomach the rancid smell, which usually brought the content down to only 25%).  This is also the first coconut oil brand that I actually tried to bake with (although it quickly used up my tub). I have subscribed for this to be delivered monthly, but I might change that to a more frequent supply of fresh tubs. After I was truly impressed by it, only then did I check out where it came from, and was surprised to find that it came from my country! Keep up the good work of making available a quality product to the whole world!"
688,B003B3OOPA,3,A few probelms,"Coconut oil is very temperature-sensitive. If the room is even slightly warm, it liquifies until it looks like water. In the fridge, it turns rock-hard. I am frequently moving it hither and thither to keep it at the consistency I like.<br /><br />The last two shipments I received were incorrectly packaged. Since it was summer and quite hot, the coconut oil arrived in its water-like state. Whoever packed them put them on their sides and consequently, several of them which were also not adequately sealed, leaked and soaked the box they came in. Amazon replaced the 3 leaky ones. Unfortunately, the same guy must have packaged them. He (she) put them in upside down. All 3 leaked.<br /><br />On the brighter side, I bought it because a doctor on line said it help cure her husband of Alzheimer's. I've been giving it to my husband who suffers from a different type of dementia. It hasn't cured him but his decline seems to have slowed and he likes the taste of it.<br /><br />Another plus is that the price at Amazon is about half of what I have seen at stores and it has many other uses."
689,B003B3OOPA,3,Made my skin dry but hair is softer,"I have been using Coconut Oil topically for 3-4 weeks and although I fell in love with how well it conditions my hair, it has caused my skin to become dryer.  My skin became noticeably itchy and scaly after using only coconut oil as a sole moisturizer for a month.  As soon as I ceased and switched to lotion, my skin became rehydrated.  It also clogged the pores on my face.  I got a couple of pimples on my cheeks where I have never had pimples before.  I'm not sure why it has not worked as well for me as others.  I have ceased using it as a skin moisturizer but will continue to apply it to my hair a few hours before I shampoo and condition my hair, hair is noticeably softer and more manageable with this product."
690,B003B3OOPA,5,Tastes Good And Is Not Expensive,"I don't know if this is making me healthier or not but I have added into my shake on recommendation from my grandmother. It tastes like coconut! I only take a teaspoon a day so I can warm up to it. After about 3 weeks I should be taking a tablespoon or 2. The price is right on this oil.<br /><br />Shake: Amazing Meal Pomegranate-Mango Superfood Powder, frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, Big Train Strawberry Smoothie Mix and Nature's Way coconut oil. This is a thick, thick shake that will fill you up for hours.<br /><br />Update 10/08/12: I have found by far the most efficient and delicious way to get my daily 1 tablespoon. Take 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and heat until it's clear and oily in a dish. Mix in 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. Stir until the peanut butter is evenly mixed into the oil. Eat on whatever. I have found that if I put large amounts on each bite, it is good sized or a bagel. The coconut oil mellows out the flavor and stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth quality of the peanut butter, so I can eat much more on a bite than if it was just peanut butter. Delicious protein and good fats."
691,B003B3OOPA,4,"Great for my hair, and cooking!","I bought this to use in a hair treatment recipe, and it left my hair soft and shiny.  I use it about once a month, and it works great! Be sure to wash your hair thoroughly afterwards so it doesn't look greasy.  I also used a couple tablespoons in some rice I cooked, and it was delicious.  This coconut oil has many wonderful uses!"
692,B003B3OOPA,5,It Works,"Gonna make this short and sweet. I use it to *shallow* fry lot's of food. I take it also just as it is when I am feeling lazy and don't feel like eating. After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3"
693,B003B3OOPA,5,Good for you in every way,"Wow, I'm learning more about natural health products and the how good they are for you.  This Coconut oil is amazing, a gift from God to us.  I used this coconut oil mix with a little baking soda to make homemade deodorant and it works unlike the ones I bought from the natural store.  I use this coconut oil to moisturize my skin, treat my hair, and to nourish my inside by taking a teaspoon a day.  This is heaven sent, and it helps to kill candida and a whole lot of other stuff! Simply put, its just good for you.  This particular brand is better than others I've compared it to.  It has more of the good fat and it tastes better.  5 thumbs up for EfaGold, and the price on amazon is fabulous too!"
694,B003B3OOPA,5,LOVE IT,"so I'm a college student who has been trying to learn how to live a much healthier life in the mist of crazy assignments and packed schedules. I bought this back in January originally for my hair since I'm an African American woman with 3c/4a natural hair. and while it has done WONDERS growing my hair, I've been even more amazed by its other talents. If you use it as an occasional moisturizer it will leave you skin sooooooo soft. I also use it now as a substtute of oil/butter when I'm using my frying pan. You can hardly taste it, and when you do it doesn't taste bad at all. And it works better than oil and butter in my opinion. I'm not a chef but it seems to still burn a little bit when you use oil or butter. With this coconut oil, i just pour a dime size in the pan and use a paper towel to distribute it evenly so it give it a nice gloss. I let it heat for just a few seconds, add my food, and then wa la! no burning, and no more unnecessary calories. I will credit it (along with my diet and exercise) for allowing me to lose 30 pounds this summer. WOOH!"
695,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product!!!,"I absolutely love this product! And I highly recommend it for women of color, who is looking for that perfect hair conditioner that moisturizes, gives a beautiful shine to your hair, and has a nice fragrance.  It is the all-purpose daily moisturizer for your skin as well. I had been looking for oil that would keep my coils hydrated and I found this coconut oil through Amazon. You will not be disappointed."
696,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil is Good for You,"After reading a book ""What if there was a cure for Alzheimers"" and finding out the importance of medium chain triglycerides in diet, I began doing a little research on my own and found this product.  It is not only good for you, it has a wonderful flavor in low temp cooking(from eggs to oatmeal), used as a spread, in morning smoothies(adds a crunch as well because it hardens when cooled) and in baking!  Amazon has the best price consistently and Natures  is the best product.  I have it on my auto ship program and love it!"
697,B003B3OOPA,5,Fantastic,"This stuff is wonderful.  You can use it as a lotion after bathing, put in your hair, roll it around in your mouth to collect bacteria (spit it out after 2 minutes) cook with it, shine your shoes with it but the very best is it makes your face feel wonderful all day.  It is by far the best night/day cream and it absorbs quickly so there is no greasy feel.  Love it!!!"
698,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this!,"I purchased this to use in place of chemical-filled skin lotions.  I had developed some allergic reactions to some items in man-made lotions and my naturopath recommended using organic coconut oil instead.  I LOVE this oil.  It has a light coconut smell that does not linger too long.  I use this all over including on my face and my skin has been more moist (no longer do my legs get dry looking), my face less oily and with fewer blemishes.  My husband has noted that my skin looks younger and fresher.  It DOES take a while to soak in so I have had to adjust my routine a bit to avoid getting oil on things but have yet to stain any clothing or other items.  I tried a couple brands I found at the store prior to ordering this after reading the reviews and have found the brand I will remain loyal to in Nature's Way Effagold.<br /><br />I have also used this in cooking and love the light coconut taste it adds to food.  I still use EVOO for certain things as the taste just compliments certain foods better, but this oil has definitely been added to the diet and is in the rotation."
699,B003B3OOPA,5,so good,i ordered this after reading alot of positive reviews.i like it so much i have it on autoship every month.i'm thinking of having it come every 2 weeks.i put it in almost everything i eat.what i have leftover i put on my hands.i feel like it is helping.i think more clearly and i think it helps my joints.in fact i ate it both on my breakfast and in my lunch today.it has a subtle coconut flavor that tastes good on almost anything.
700,B003B3OOPA,4,Great for homemade baby wipes,"I bought this product to make homemade baby wipes with and it's great for that.  I'm not planning on using it for cooking, but I might make a sugar scrub for my feet with it."
701,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,This product is truly amazing.  I use it every day on my arms to help add moisture to my dry skin.  It has helped smooth the lines and dry skin without the oily feeling of most moisturizers.
702,B003B3OOPA,5,Very pleasant aroma......Not heady,"Great aroma and wonderful flavor.  Coming from the land of coconuts, I found this to be a superior product similar to what we get there - a high quality.  Some refined oils have a heady aroma which gets ""cooked"" out.  This one retains its aroma even after cooking. I have used it for sauteing, pan-frying and seasoning with no flavor loss.  Tastes even delicious when raw.  Bit on the expensive side but I'm ready to pay that extra penny for great flavor."
703,B003B3OOPA,5,Organic coconut oil,"High quality, great price, convenient  size, I keep it handy in the kitchen to add to whatever I cook. Use it in place of/ with  regular cooking oil.. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3OOPA"">Nature's Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce</a>"
704,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious and healthy - Organic EV Coconut Oil,"I'm a recent convert to the overwhelming benefits of coconut oil. I previously used the Spectrum Naturals brand from a local grocery chain, but gave this one a try because it was a little less expensive. This coconut oil is far better in my opinion. It smells great in the jar, and smells AMAZING when cooking. I've used it for almost every meal I've needed oil for since getting it: browning meat, making crepes, even homemade marinades. When cooking a recipe with many ingredients the flavor tends to get lost, but for less complex meals (like lime shrimp I sauteed last week) you could taste a hint of coconut in the meal. What a fantastic addition! So far everyone, even our kids, has had nothing but rave reviews about it.<br /><br />It's summer and very warm here, so when we got our first jar it was completely liquid. It was a surprise to me, because every jar I'd bought at the store was always like a thick white paste. No worries; if that bothers you, just put in the fridge and it'll harden right up."
705,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product!,"We have at least three brands of coconut oil at my house, and this has been the best quality yet! great for cooking, and tastes good. you can tell the quality is higher when all three brands heat up. Natures Way is the only brand you can easily see through, very pure. I liked it and I'm back for more!"
706,B003B3OOPA,5,Works magically on hair,"I used to straighten my hair A LOT and have decided to wear it more naturally. Therefore I find when I mix this coconut oil with some olive oil and aloe vera, I get soft, shiny hair. I really advise that you all do the same, but make sure not to put too much in otherwise you will be a grease head. But this coconut oil is truly amazing."
707,B003B3OOPA,5,This is the Best cooking oil!,"I've been using this coconut oil for several months now, and I love it! Tastes delicious. I even eat it by the spoonful. Sits on my kitchen counter, and never goes rancid. Solid but melts at 72 degrees, so it's easy to use whenever I need oil to cook with. Plus Coconut oil is very good for you. My cholesterol is under control, my veins and arteries are clear. My weight is normal. All these things have happened since I started using this oil. I highly recommend it."
708,B003B3OOPA,5,Nature's Way EfaGold Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil,"I was so happy to receive my Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. It arrived when it was estimated to arrive, it was packaged properly. My only concern at first was that the oil was in liquid format. But after reading the the information on the back of the jar, it did state that it will become solid at room temperature. So I will wait to see if it gets solid. I have ordered coconut oil in the past, but it did not smell like coconut. This product actually smells like coconut. I love the smell. I have opened the jar at least 5 times while writing this to take in the aroma. So excited to try my new coconut oil on my newly natural hair."
709,B003B3OOPA,5,SUPER!,"Mine arrived already liquified, probably because I live in Florida and it's the summer temps!  But, I used a small ""turkey baster"" I bought from the salon supply store for acetone to add some to my hair potion and it smelled awesome enough o eat!  Even though I bought it for cosmetic purposes, I just may have to try it for cooking! Anyway, I also added a bit that was lingering on the foil seal to my curly baby hairs around my face and they were instantly soft, shiny ringlets! There's is quite a good amount in this sized container to last a while too. A little goes a long way! I am impressed with this product and will be buying it regularly in the future!"
710,B003B3OOPA,5,YUM! All aboard the coconut train!!,If you don't know how good this is for you.... If you don't know how great the quality of this brand.... well you're missing out. When you get to heaven's gate I assure you St. Peter will remind you of my words.
711,B003B3OOPA,5,Best on the market,"Just buy this brand! I have tried all the rest and this one is the best for cooking, using it on skin and hair. Coconut is so good for you. Its the magic cure for everything. It has the good fat in it. Buy a book on the mirical of coconut oil and sit back and be amazed at what it can do for you and change your life. Study up on other oils for cooking and be prepared to be horrified! If your using it for skin or nails. This is the brand. Love love coconut oil!"
712,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Stuff!,"Using it for fat loss, and a healthy source of Medium Chain Triglycerides. I take it pre-workout and it gives a bit of an energy boost in my opinion. Great for cooking. I highly recommend this product for everyday health and or fitness goals."
713,B003B3OOPA,5,strongly recommend,"Do yourself a favor and spend some time researching the health benefits of Coconut oil. The sites all recommend you make sure the product is ""PURE"". Now go out and find the best product at the most competitive price. You don't have to look far, Natures Way PURE organic extra Virgin Coconut Oil is it."
714,B003B3OOPA,5,"Once you start, you won't go back","This brand is one of the best brands I have tried. It is very tasty. For cooking...you can use a couple of tablespoons of this to fry pancakes, stir fry or any other recipes that call for butter or margarine. I almost never use margarine now. I even put it on corn and my breakfast toast. Coconut oil contains Medium Chain Triglycerides which is known to aid in weight loss and lower cholesterol levels. For skin...Since hearing about coconut oil, it is the only thing I use to moisturize my skin. I even put a little on my face at night. My skin is even more beautiful now. For hair...after I wash my hair, I rub a little in while it is still wet. After it dries, there is so much sheen and shine, there is no need for anything else. FABULOUS!"
715,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"This oil has many different uses.  I have cooked with it and it works and tastes good.  I have used it on my hair as well as skin and am pleased with the results.  Good price for the amount you get.  Will be ordering more once this runs out, which won't be soon because a little bit goes a long way."
716,B003B3OOPA,4,Coconut oil,This oil is great for cooking and apply in your skin. As far as giving you more energy- I feel no dofference. But it's great to know that this is healthy to use.
717,B003B3OOPA,5,great,The product came very quickly. It was fresh and just what I expected. Prefect for a summer time moisterizer and great to cook with!
718,B003B3OOPA,5,very very very good product,"got this product first time at the local wholefoods and got hooked. I use it as a butter to put on a toast, I add it to my meat dishes, I eat it from the spoon with my tea and apply it as a body lotion...that is how much ""action"" you can get out of that jar. It has a very pleasant light coconut taste and aroma. Just a very good product overall."
719,B003B3OOPA,5,great coconut oil and great price!,I use a lot of coconut oil. It's great for anything from moisturizing your skin to cooking vegetables. This brand is a good brand. I alternate between Nature's Way Organic and Nutiva Organic depending on whichever one is cheaper when i reorder.
720,B003B3OOPA,5,You can get addicted to this stuff..,"What do i do with this stuff ???  I eat it... It taste great... 4 tables spoons a day...I will be reorderng soon... I just read that dogs love it to, so I will also be giving it to them... Just not as much...  Try it you will love it... To me it taste just like cream of coconut...."
721,B003B3OOPA,5,The benefits are amazing,"This product is amazing. I had no idea how many benefits one jar could have. Use it on your entire body, eat it, cook with it. It helps everything from dry skin and hair to blood pressure and diabetics. It also boosts your metabolism. If you are thinking of purchasing this product just do a google search on benefits of coconut oil and read up on it. You will not be disappointed."
722,B003B3OOPA,5,"Tasty, health oil.","This oil is not liquid at room temperature. Also, it has a relatively low smoke point. Those facts out of they way, this is a very high quality coconut oil. It smells wonderful and everything cooked in it takes on a hint of coconut. I use this in my coffee, fry eggs in it, saute spinach in it, as well as enjoy a tablespoon of it before my workouts. I have read that there are non-food related things you can do with this as well (good for skin, etc) but I have only experienced it through a culinary lens."
723,B003B3OOPA,5,Hair SOOO Soft Skin so Soft,I really am happy with this product. It moisturizes my hair extremely well and doesnt leave a look of build up and absorbs beautifully. I have 4a hair in lower back length locks and absorbtion is something that is a must for anything i use in my hair.I am excited to continue using it and I also have used it on my skin. I absorbs well to the skin too leaving my skin supple but not greesy.<br /><br />If you dont like the smell of coconut it may not be the product for you. But if you enjoy the smell it is very pleasant and it is not over powering.I will try mixing this into a whipped shea butter blend also for skin and let you guys know how it come out :-)
724,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful,It is everything everyone said it was and more! I love it in either oatmeal or cream of wheat. will order again.
725,B003B3OOPA,5,Healthy and Yum!,"I bought this a couple of months ago after learning that coconut oil is very healthy for you. I love coconut flavor, so this was easy for me to take. I love it. I cook Shirataki noodles in it, eggs, anything. I especially love to eat hot cereal and put a dollop of coconut oil in it. It's really delish. I hope all the health claims I read are true! Start slow, though. The first week I had a lot of diarrhea. I think your body takes time to get used to it; I don't have that problem anymore."
726,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil in PLASTIC!,Gosh Darn It! It looks like a glass jar but it isn't. Coconut oil is a great product but should be packaged in glass only. Need to beg my neighbor for some baby food jars to transfer the oil into. I hope baby food still comes in glass. (smile)
727,B003B3OOPA,5,"Coconut Oil ""Miracle of Nature""","I purchased this product and used it for one month. I had lab work taken in February prior to starting the use of the coconut oil. Then I started using the coconut oil, in my food and on my skin. I used the whole 16 oz container in March. Then I had my labs redone in April 1st. My A1C in February was 9.7 the most recent A1C is now 7 which is almost normal. So even though I was also taking my medication, the addition of the coconut oil was the miracle in my book. I have signed up for subscribe and save and will be using the coconut oil with a shipment monthly. I was hesitant at what the results would be as I have tried other things, but it works. Used it on a skin rash as soon as it started and within two days it was gone. Try it for yourself."
728,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil and HDL,"Purchased Coconut oil to help punch up my HDL ""good"" cholesterol levels. We use it for cooking and I also may mix it in cooked vegetables like you might use butter. I like the taste and coconut oil medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are supposed to be a lot healthier for us than most vegetable oils."
729,B003B3OOPA,5,hoping for great results,"Bought this for my Dad who has dementia, hoping it will help him, even a little...my Mom ended up also using it as a face cream, and loves it! She adds it to her cereal every morning, too!"
730,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for cooking,"I really like this product.  We use it for making microwave popcorn, cooking eggs, sauteing vegetables, etc.  When used in cooking, there is little to no coconut taste transferred to the food.  Best of all, it's a healthy fat."
731,B003B3OOPA,5,Yummy!,"I've been using coconut oil for a long time.  After reading the many compliments via various websites I gave it a try.  I mainly use it for cooking, but also oral health after brushing my teeth.  Your teeth will feel like satin after placing a 1/2 tsp. in your mouth and allowing it to melt.  Swish it around, then rinse.  I've tried numerous brands and can't say enough about this one.  Well priced, clean tasting, a hint of coconut smell.  Top quality."
732,B003B3OOPA,5,YUM!  AMBROSIA!,"After reading several of Bruce Fife's books (and they were wonderfully easy-to-read for the non-scientific type), I decided to give coconut oil a try to help with losing weight and getting my blood sugar under control. As a non-medication taking, recently diagnosed diabetic, I want to try whatever natural remedies I can find to stay off insulin and other diabetes meds, in addition to meds for cholesterol, etc. I tried taking a teaspoon or two with meals and a teaspoon btw meals and my blood sugar numbers were noticeably lower the same day. (Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet! I will definitely be using this instead of any oils for all my cooking needs (except a little EVOO mixed together with this for salad dressing.) Also, I'm using on my skin and it feels really soft, plus you also get the internal benefits from using it on your skin! GREAT PRODUCT!"
733,B003B3OOPA,5,Works Wonders for Black Hair,"I've gone to wearing my hair ""natural""--no chemical relaxers to straighten it. On advice from other African-American women who have also gone the natural route, I tried mixing coconut oil, unrefined shea butter, and aloe gel to use on my hair. The results are nothing short of miraculous! My hair is soft, shiny, and manageable. I use the braid-out/twist-out styling methods, and the resulting curls and spirals are absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Also, I've read up on the health benefits of coconut oil, so I will definitely be experimenting with it in my cooking."
734,B003B3OOPA,5,Multipurpose Item,"This item is extremely good. If your looking for pure extra virgin Coconut oil,this is your product. I use it in my hair, on my body as a moisturizer, in my food and also as a supplement. It's the best and for a very good price."
735,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing Stuff!,"We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.<br /><br />We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.<br /><br />Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.<br /><br />Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.<br /><br />Highly Recommended."
736,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent facial moisturizer,"I use this on my face in the evening.  At first it seems really greasy, but after about 5 minutes it totally soaks in - doesn't leave any residue/stains on my pillowcase.  I also use it on my lips.  Definitely recommend :)"
737,B003B3OOPA,5,instant pedicure in a bottle,"I purchased this after scouring onc of my favorite sites [...]  about natural ways to deal with rough, dry, feet.  I get biweekly pedicures but that gets expensive!  One of the reviewers recommended applying coconut oil daily and you'll never have to worry about rough feet again.  I have to honestly admit that she was right!  I only get a pedicure for the pampering every couple of months no longer the necessity and because of the results I apply the coconut oil to my entire body after the bath and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture.  It's unbelievable.  The only thing about this one is during the summer months you have to find a cool place in the house to keep this such as underneath the bathroom cabinet or in the linen closet because it will liquify.  As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.  But I love, love, love this product.  It's a must have.  It's has a light, chocolate fragrance to it which is a plus."
738,B003B3OOPA,4,Just what my doctor ordered,"I like this product very much. It came very quickly and was the actual coconut oil(not the gel tablets). I was using it as a hair conditioner but it is edible and can be used as a cooking oil and as an anti-fungal treatment. It tasted sweet and the container was generous. Overall, I am happy with the product and the pricing."
739,B003B3OOPA,5,Just Like the Oil my Mama Made,"I am from Asian descent and we regularly use coconut oil for everything. My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat, hand pressing the liquids, then boil the water out. This oil tastes and smells just like the kind my Mother used to spend hours making.  This is definitely worth the price for the amount of oil that you get. I use this as a hair detangler out of the shower, as make-up remover, face and body moisturizer, and lip balm. I also use it for cooking and as a dietary supplement."
740,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product for great price thanks All star health,"I bought this product from the amazon vendor ALL STAR HEALTH and I must say it is just as described and got speedy shipment. This is great for my hair and skin. I've made Ice pops for my kid sister,her friends, and myself and they taste great. I am afro Caribbean with wavy hair opposed to super kinky hair but my hair gets really dry if I leave it out(wash n set style). But this is great for those using protective styling and for the swimmers like myself. It keeps my hair moist and doesn't weigh it down and my skin look great as well. People don't realize that the chlorine in our shower/water systems here in the states is very drying on our hair and bodies. I'm just glad I got a product that 100% natural and from a vendor who I can trust. I've been ripped off by buying hair products at walmart and supply stores. I live in a predominantly white neighborhood and it is very hard finding things that work for my hair. So, I have to go to neighborhoods out of my way or shop online. And after finding out I bought conditioner that was mixed with bleach (clorox) from an online store that turned my hair into straw/ash it can be very frustrating. So I had to cut off my hair about 5 inches and I'm re-growing it. I had to file a claim with the business bureau and everything. But, thank god for reviews or I wouldn't know where to shop or who to trust these days."
741,B003B3OOPA,5,"BEST OIL FOR BAKING, FRYING, SKIN SOFTENER, OR RIGHT OUT OF THE JAR","After menopause, I developed high total cholesterol.  Fortunately, only the ""lousy"" cholesterol (LDH) increased, with my ""happy"" number (HDL) staying at an impressive 90.  Instead of taking the recommended ""liptor, et al"", and as a registered nurse who knows the awful side effects of such drugs, I opted to research all things diet related.  After my studies, I have decided that our government and medical community has been either ignorant, at best, or complicit, at worst, in the great soybean growers maligning of the health benefits of this oil.  There are a few good scientific books available through Amazon.  I'm not due for another lipid test for at least a year.  I will post an update here, good or bad outcome.<br /><br />Whole Foods stopped carrying this brand.  I tried their new 365 brand and had to spit it out --- TOTAL PLASTIC TASTE AND SMELL.  This product is in a non-leaching plastic container and is incredibly pleasant tasting raw (only do that after eating anything sweetened with sugar or honey to prevent cavities), but unbelievably delicious in cooking.  Last week I was in an interview and the lady turned and smiled stating she detected a ""slight, delightful hint of just-baked cookies"" coming from my direction.  HAD TO BE THIS OIL I always pop a little in my mouth before going out!!!!!<br /><br />Watch the medical statistics that will be coming out of the country of Jamaica in the next two to three years.  The soybean inudstry has recently purchased all the coconut fields, torn down the trees, and planted soybeans!!!!!  If the studies I am trusting in are correct, they will begin developing a high incidence of heart disease and strokes, almost unknown to them up until now!!!!!"
742,B003B3OOPA,3,coconut oil,this product is good but doesn't quite have as much taste as I had hoped for. Also I thought it would be thicker.
743,B003B3OOPA,5,In Love!,"I absolutely love this stuff! I use it for my hair, skin,and  lips (tastes good).  I haven't cooked  with it.... Yet! It melts into the palm of your hand, no need to put it in warm water. (you may need to it you live in a place that is very cold. I live in Calif)  It absorbs into your skin and hair without feeling greasy. I wash my hair and while it is wet I put the oil in it and comb it through. I have thick curly hair and it leaves it soft when it dries. The whole family can use it. Definitely putting it on auto-order! and it is so affordable!  I recommended this to all my friends and family on FB."
744,B003B3OOPA,5,Crazy for Coconut oil,This product is very good. When you taste it you feel the quality of it. It is really organic. It combines delicious taste with healthy benefits
745,B003B3OOPA,5,A natural way to stay healthy,I was curious about coconut oil because of it's anti viral and antibacterial properties as a natural supplement instead of using over the counter meds.. I am quite pleased.. I've started taking it everyday and I feel healthier. It tastes so good... I have yet to cook with it but I do use it as a spread on bagels or crackers.. Tastes wonderfully.. I use it on my lips and skin aswell.. It is a wonderful moisturizer... I am blown away by the many uses of this coconut oil.. I'm a believer..
746,B003B3OOPA,4,Wonderful product,"High quality!  I ordered 3 tubs a few months ago and now I'm back for more!  I use it on my skin, in my hair and in my food."
747,B003B3OOPA,5,First Timer,"Wow...I cannot believe how unbelievable this product is.  I am trying to eat healthier and find better alternatives to eating organic as well as preserve the taste of food, or even better, make it tastier.  Although it has been just a bit challenging to eat organic and also consume healthy, tasty products, this has made cutting fast foods completely out TOTALLY WORTH IT. I cannot believe I have never cooked with coconut oil before.  I used it with my ordinary seafood dish and popcorn butter substitute.  It melts immediately and adds a crisp to whatever savory dish you are making.  The faint, but identifiable taste of coconut oil makes the dish even BETTER.  SERIOUSLY, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?  With all the positive reviews, purchasing an item for the first time can be a tiny, wee bit difficult for a newbie.  However, if you are planning to eat healthy and use better cooking alternative oils and saturate your food with a bit more fat (good fat), use coconut oil.  Since this was the brand and product that immediately popped up when I was looking for coconut oil, I will say this is a very high quality and yummmmmmy item to purchase.  I will definitely incorporate more coconut oil in most of all my dishes as I cook many of meals.  Although I have not yet cooked a sweet dish using coconut oil, I am assuming it will be quite delicious as well.  I still cannot get over how additionally tasty my food is with this new additional to my cooking ingredient cart.  So worth it...I recommend this product to everyone and will be talking my family into this cooking alternative immediately.  Delicious and healthy."
748,B003B3OOPA,5,CoconUT........,"This really smells good..... it smooths my hands, love putting it on after a hot shower smooths my skin. Great for my hair, it absorbs and smooths out my hair, leaving it silky and manageable. I love Coconut oil...it couldn't get more healthy."
749,B003B3OOPA,3,Coconut Oil,"I was really excited about using this product for my dry skin and hair.  It has worked nicely on my hair, as long as I'm careful to not use too much (I have very thin, fine hair).  Unfortunately my skin has not liked it at all.  I've been using it on my face, and it has actually made my skin drier and flakier.  I don't understand why this would happen."
750,B003B3OOPA,5,"Awesome taste, nutrition.","This is an excellent product, good for 160 or more areas of treatment and nutrition, delicious plain on a rice cracker, wonderful in salad dressings."
751,B003B3OOPA,5,Great buy!,"I bought this coconut oil because my older sister uses it on her skin at night and she has such smooth, wrinkle-free skin. I love this stuff. It smells great of course, I use it in my hair, skin, cuticles and you can even eat it! It is a lot of product so it's a really good value. It is stored at room temp. and is great for just about any use."
752,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazingly Good!  Gorgeous Coconut Flavor.,"Love this stuff. So yummy, and the dogs love it too!  So glad that I bought it, and will keep doing it over and over again."
753,B003B3OOPA,4,So far so good!,"I began using this 2 nights ago as a nightly moisturizer and I'm already seeing positive results.  Other than occasional pimples, my only skip issue was wrinkles beginning to appear (I'm only 22 so either I don't drink enough water or I'm way too stressed for my age).  Though the deeper wrinkles have not completely disappeared, they are definitely diminished and barely noticeable unless you're very close to my forehead.  Love this so far! (And it smells wonderful!)"
754,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!,This product works great on my hair as a hot oil treatment and conditioner.  It is also great for skin care and is gentle enough for children.
755,B003B3OOPA,5,Exellent!,"Product just as described, smells & tastes awesome. I really plan on making lotion with it. Not expired and packaged great!"
756,B003B3OOPA,5,Good for oil pulling and consumption,"I decided to try oil pulling, and selected this coconut oil to try with.  I will say - I'm not sure if I buy into the whole coconut oil pulling ""thing"", but anything's worth a shot!  I found that it's best (for me) to put a glob of the oil UNDER my tounge to melt.  Just sticking a glob in my mouth on top of my tounge made me want to barf.  After it melts under my tounge, I can swish it - and the taste is very subtle.  It almost feels like I'm just swishing saliva around.<br /><br />I also decided to start incorporating this oil into my morning cup of coffee as I've seen other reviews mention.  It doesn't really add any taste, but is an easy way to get this in my body - also moisturizes my lips as I drink it!  Yum!<br /><br />I haven't tried any other coconut oils, but this seems to fit the bill - no complaints!"
757,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Multi-Use Product,"I love this coconut oil! I use it to take off makeup, as a moisturizer, as a conditioner, and as a cooking oil!<br /><br />As a makeup remover, I use it on dry skin and rub the oil in for around a minute. Then using a warm/hot towel, I let the towel sit on my face until cool. I repeat the process with the towel 2-3 times (depending on how much makeup I have on) and then in slow, circular motions, I rub the makeup off with my towel. It takes off all my makeup, my waterproof mascara, and my sunblock. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped of oil.<br /><br />As a moisturizer, I use it only at night (too oily to use in the morning), after my toner and green cream. I take a little bit and warm it in the palm of my hand. I rub it into my dry spots (which have sometimes crop up due to my use of green cream) and follow up with a cream-based moisturizer to seal it in. I put a bit around my eyes and some on my eyelashes and eyebrows. In the morning, my skin looks plump and remarkably fresh! I love it!<br /><br />As a conditioner, I place a little bit of it in damp hair and leave it in overnight. After washing, my hair (which has been permed, colored, bleached, and ironed to hell and back) feels soft and conditioned!!<br /><br />As a cooking oil, I just use it like I would use olive oil or any other cooking oil. There have been claims that this oil will help with weight loss, but I haven't really noticed any of that. I use it mainly because it smells delicious!! It's great when making curry!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
758,B003B3OOPA,4,Great product.,"I must begin by saying I LOVE coconut oil. Cooking, beauty, healthcare...I've used it in many different applications. The reason I took off a star is because when this shipped (in a warm month) it came liquified and upon solidifying became somewhat grainy. I tried a different brand that came the same way but solidified without any graininess. If you're not going to consume it straight out of the container this should not bother you at all."
759,B003B3OOPA,4,Yet another coconut oil review,"When I looked to buy coconut oil, I had no idea there was such a avid fan base.  So I'll make it short.  I've bought one other brand of coconut oil besides this, and they both are about the same,  except that this brand stand in a more liquid form longer than the other brand.  (which turns out to be great when adding it to homemade ice cream!)  Besides that I was satisfied with both.  I bought this because it was more economical.  I didn't think I'd like the subscription program, but it's turning out to be VERY convenient.  I was able to change the options around right before delivery, and it comes just like it should.  Plus, I know the product and the price I'm getting without having to make the arduous health food store comparison shopping drive.<br /><br />That's about the best you can ask for a product like this.  If it's going to cost more than regular butter and oil, at least it's a good product, and comes without me going to fetch it."
760,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!,"I purchased this after trying other Coconut Oil.  This has a better taste than others, I love it and cannot wait to begin getting my shipments.  I may have to up the frequency of my shipment as I'm using it in all sorts of dishes."
761,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent,"A quick net search can tell you all the things coconut oil is good for, take your pick. I like this product for everything.  A little goes a long way, can't be without it."
762,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells sooo good!,"I use this in my Shea Butter Whips, and it just smells soooo good. I have tried others but this one is the best."
763,B003B3OOPA,5,BEST ORGANIC COCONUT OIL,NATURES WAY IS A VERY REPUTABLE SUPPLEMENT COMPANY. This organic coconut oil has a smooth taste and great flavor. It taste and smells like real coconut without any artificial junk. I am a nutritionist & vegetarian & consume only organic and chemical free food. This coconut oil fulfills all the excellent health benefits of coconut oil.
764,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious and nutritious,"This coconut oil is a great product, and at a good price on Amazon.  Organic, unrefined coconut oil can be expensive when purchased locally.  I started using this regularly for cooking and baking, and I'm very pleased with the results!  It's delicious on toast, waffles and pancakes, and perfect for stir-frying vegetables and meats, as it has a better heat tolerance than olive oil.  Also, I believe it's helped me with my cholesterol imbalance. I tested once at a low HDL (good) level.  After some research on the benefits of unrefined coconut oil on cholesterol, I gave it a try.  A recent blood test confirmed an increase to a healthy HDL level, as well as a low LDL (bad) level."
765,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious coconut oil!,"I've been using coconut oil for a few years now and am pleased to see that its benefits are finally being touted...now that saturated fat is no longer villainified, thank goodness. Coconut oil's praises are long overdue! We used to buy more expensive coconut oil; but these are tough economic times, so we've been using cheap coconut oil. I read all the great reviews on this site and can't believe that for the cheap price, it's organic AND cold-pressed/hexane-free. We've got another brand of what I'd loosely dub coconut oil sitting in the cabinet next to this brand, and although they are similar in price, that's where the similarities end. That stuff is going in the garbage where it belongs. I could barely even taste coconut when using it. I won't go back.<br /><br />I eat about 3 tbsp of this stuff per day and, naturally, it's satisfying. As soon as you open the jar, you can smell the coconut. And the taste...delicious! If you're already a fan of coconut oil and are aware of its healthy properties, try this brand. You won't be sad that you did. And if you're just learning about its merits, this coconut oil is perfect to start using. If you don't like it, you haven't really lost much money. I ""subscribed"" to this product in order to ensure that I've always got a fresh tub on hand!"
766,B003B3OOPA,5,Coocoo for Coconut Oil!,"Great product!  I use it for cooking and in my smoothies.  The flavor is wonderful, and it always seems to bring out the natural flavors of meat and seafood.  It has also helped me control and lose weight.  I weighed in at 205 lbs at the beginning of the year and with proper diet, exercise and a spoonful of coconut oil daily, I have lost 25 lbs.  If you want to cut out salt and sugar from your diet but not taste, try cooking with coconut oil.  It will enhance the flavors of your food and help you fix those nasty cravings."
767,B003B3OOPA,5,So many uses,"This product is great. I use it on my and my baby after showers/baths and it has cleared up my skin from many different blemishes (Dry spots, red patches and red bumps I have had for years). I have also used it on my hair and it has helped get rid of the dry brittle frizz.<br />Since I use it everyday it has helped me not to get sunburned.<br />I also have used it on popcorn (so good) and with cooking rice. Can't wait to find more cooking uses for it.<br />Also a very good price and I love that I don't have to go to the store to get more when I run out."
768,B003B3OOPA,4,love this stuff!!,So I've used it twice now...only for my hair ..I just put it all over my head and leave it in for about 2 hours..then wash it out really good because if you leave some in after you shower it still feels oily...I usually have to wash my hair twice<br />..but it feels sooooo soft after I use it.  I notice that my ends haven't been breaking as bad..and im the type of person that styles my hair almost everyday :) definitely recommend.
769,B003B3OOPA,5,Hair Revitalizer,"My hair, for the most part, is healthy & easy to maintain, but I couldn't grow it past the middle of my back. At that point, the ends become terribly brittle & eventually fray. However, that's no longer a problem since I started using coconut oil as a deep conditioner. The jar says to apply 1-2 hours before washing your hair, but it's obviously better if you leave it in longer. After one use (overnight), my split ends were substantially reduced, all the strands felt smooth from root to tip, & my waves were at their bounciest! Not only is it the most effective solution I've come across, it's also natural & the cheapest.<br /><br />I can't really comment on its other curative properties aside from skincare. I would advise against it in favor of jojoba oil. Coconut oil is heavier & may clog pores. However, it doesn't deserve to get knocked for that considering how well it works on hair.<br /><br />Also, the oil will congeal if it gets in the low 70s. Don't freak out, it's still good & less messy to apply since you can get a good amount on your fingers. If you can't get down like that, just put it in hot water & it will return to its liquid state. Oh, and be careful if you intend to take it as a supplement. You have to ease your body into it & only take a little at a time, like if you're trying to build an immunity to arsenic. Unknowingly, I took the recommended amount (jar, I trusted you!) & proceeded to have my insides torn apart.<br /><br />So, if you can remember these tips, you'll be well on your way to beautiful hair!"
770,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I love this product. I use it three ways. First I use it as a daily skin moisturizer. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day without a heavy oily feel. I also use it as part of my hair regimen. I mix it with shea butter and jojoba oil to moisturize my natural locs. Finally, it is food grade. I use it as a spread on toast instead of butter and jams. It has a light sweet taste. Overall, I love this product and it is of high quality."
771,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!!!!!!!!!,"This coconut oil smells divine.  I love to use it for moisturizing my hair, since I am going natural, and am not quite ready for the big chop.  The oil is light, and I love it. Makes my hair smell so wonderful."
772,B003B3OOPA,5,Best Coconut Oil,"I love the versatality of this oil. It is good coconut oil but not to strong. I use it on my skin, hair and had a teaspoon or 2 in my cocoa tea and it works well in all. I am not certain about the usage on my face though - my skin started feeling a bit dry after a few applications at night. So I am still looking into that. All in all it is a good product for a good price!"
773,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Stuff!,I love this stuff! I have 4c natural hair and this coconut oil penetrated and moisturized my hair like nobodies business. I've had this since August 2010 and I'm just now purchasing another one so it will take you far.
774,B003B3OOPA,5,Outstanding and Delicious,"I ordered on January 9th and received it on January 11th.  Amazing : )<br />I've never purchased or used Coconut Oil - organic or otherwise - but I've been checking out some of it's health benefits.  After reading the positive reviews and seeing the great low price, I had to try it.<br /> I've been battling dry mouth and thought I'd coat my tongue and gums before I go to bed.  Maybe it will help ""seal in"" the moisture.  Who knows.  If it doesn't, it's a delicious mistake.  It's REALLY YUMMY!<br />I'd definitely recommend it -"
775,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!,"EFAGold Coconut Oil is wonderful. I use this product in my hair to seal in moisture (love it). A little goes a long way, so be very light-handed if using in the hair. The shipment was quick I have no complaints!"
776,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product,"Great product, tastes great. I mixed this with some banana cream pudding and it was heavenly. The coconut flavor and smell it gives is incredible. I also add 2 tblsp to my green tea with honey and it gives my tea that extra yum factor. Will be reordering this product and i am currently actively trying out new recipes for this. I bought 2-16 oz jars, but i can quickly see that will not be enough as i will be using it on skin and hair. This is the real deal, it is not the refined oil you find in grocery stores. Refined vs Unrefined, i'll go with unrefined."
777,B003B3OOPA,3,is it safe to store oil in BPA bottle?,Just want to remind you that this wonderful coconut oil is store in plastic container labelled #1 which is not BPA free.
778,B003B3OOPA,5,awesome product!,"If you want soft skin, shiny hair, strong bones, good digestion and something that tastes great, you will want to buy this!  And, as a side benefit, I have lost 4 lbs in just two weeks by eating 1 tbsp a half hour before meals."
779,B003B3OOPA,3,Very strong coconut flavor,"This seems a good product, but, if you are using it in the kitchen, be sure you like a strong coconut flavor. I previously had used the Whole Foods coconut oil, and it does not have a pronounced coconut taste, so I was unprepared for the strong flavor of this product. I'll keep what I have left for moisturizer and conditioner."
780,B003B3OOPA,5,DELICIOUS,"I've had this product for a total of 48 hours and I'm raving about it already, it tastes AMAZING you can literally not go wrong with this product. Don't like the results on your hair? Try it on that dry patch of skin you have. Not healing it quick enough? Put it on a piece of toast. Coconut flavor too strong? Bake with it as a substitute for other butters/oils in recipes. And statistically, how can one person not be happy with at least one of these options that coconut oil offers? Honestly, this is the smartest purchase I have ever made, I will never go back to putting butter on toast, the coconut flavor is absolutely delicious. The texture is much lighter and it just smells so.amazingly.GOOD. I love how the subtle taste infused into my sunny side up egg, and although I haven't tried it in other foods yet, I'm REALLY looking forward to doing so IMMEDIATELY!!"
781,B003B3OOPA,5,Lowered my triglycerides,Who knew coconut oil lowers cholesteral? We added one tablespoon per day. Fasting cholesterol test show it cut my trigliceride number in half.
782,B003B3OOPA,5,Heals Eczema & Restore Skin Smoothness!!!,I gave this to my cousin who has been struggling for eczema since childhood (now 35yr). He used it and his skin completely cleared up. My gf also uses this and her dry cracked skins are now even smoother than mine! As smooth as a babies bottom!
783,B003B3OOPA,4,As expected,This is a good quality organic coconut oil. Only suggestion I would make to the manufacturer - use glass instead of plastic.
784,B003B3OOPA,5,Love This!,"Nature's Way coconut oil is amazingly gentle. I was able to orally take 4 TBS daily within 2 weeks of starting this oil with no diarrhea. It brought my blood pressure down from 150/80 to 126/62. My skin soaks it up and looks younger. I eat it with my meals. It has a mild, pleasant coconut taste. It is doing many good things internally that Iam not even aware of."
785,B003B3OOPA,5,Good hair mask,I use coconut oil for my hair like a regular hair mask 15 min. before duche.Your hair will feel the differens.Good product.
786,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful!,"Bought this organic coconut oil as a nutritional supplement..for myself...and for 2 baby squirrels I am raising (according to a squirrel rehab expert, coconut oil is great for baby squirrels because of the many similarities between the fats in coconut oil and the fats in mother squirrel milk.)  Anyway, both myself and the squirrels love it!  It tastes great just on its own...I'm looking forward to trying it as a spread on whole wheat bread.  I recommend this product very highly...it's delicious!"
787,B003B3OOPA,5,EXCELLENT Hair Conditioner - Blonde Hair,"I LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR!  I am caucasian with blonde highlighted hair. My hair strands are fine but I do have a lot of hair and it is relatively long. My scalp is also naturally a little oily. My hair is healthy, but I do need deep conditioning though as I expose my hair to a lot of elements. (I give all of this detail in case someone is making the decision for themselves as identifies with my hair profile.)<br /><br />My Hubby is a hairdresser / salon owner and because of this I get to try all kinds of hair products.  I've even had expensive caviar shampoo and conditioner (As I roll my eyes). I've used other oils in my hair and most require several washings to get the oil out.  Not this Coconut Oil.  I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap a satin wrapping cap around it while I sleep.  (available near the relaxer s in the hair care section of the store) When I wake I shampoo an condition like normal and my hair looks amazing! I use it twice a week now!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Nothing and I mean nothing has made my hair feel as silky and look as shiny as this Coconut Oil.<br /><br />The oil starts out think like crisco but melts in your hands when rubbed together quickly.  This consistency makes it super easy to apply.<br /><br />It isn't runny or drippy.<br /><br />Amazingly ""repairs"" hair after too much sun, surf, chlorine etc.<br /><br />When washed it does not leave a fragrance behind.<br /><br />No Chemicals! 100% Organic and good for you!<br /><br />THE TRICKY<br /><br />It smell of the coconut is rich and luscious and I love it -  but it was hard to ignore it when I woke up or turned over in the night.  It only took about two applications though for me to get used to it."
788,B003B3OOPA,5,SOOOOO DAMN TASTY,"I originally purchased this to use a something to give juicyness and flavor to plain meals such as chicken breast and spinach. I ate some of this with coconut cookies and couldn't stop until I accepted that it is oil... so I can't be eating insane amounts of it. Very nice that it has good fats in it as well. I used a bit as  moisturizer for my face after it was quite dry and my face was supppppppper hydrated and moist after, so make sure you barely put as much as the size of this 'O' on your finger tip."
789,B003B3OOPA,4,I like the product,"But there is something strange about the packaging.  My home is constantly over 76F, so it is always a liquid.  When it arrived, the box was partially soaked with coconut oil.  I can't find the leak and the bottle and inner seal seems to be ok.  Since I only use it for hair and skin care, I am keeping it.<br /><br />The smell is really nice and not overwhelming.  Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.  But whether it does anything to the skin long term is another story.<br /><br />BTW, many other oils are near odourless.  This oil is the exception that have a faint coconut odour to it."
790,B003B3OOPA,5,LOVE  LOVE  LOVE,My hair is in love!!! I really like it :)<br />Soft and shiny was the result after I used this in my curly hair.<br />Watch out: A little bit goes a long way!!!<br />Even better with rosemary oil.
791,B003B3OOPA,5,Does it all!!,"I bought this jar after eating coconut water for years and continuously hearing about how beneficial the oil is.  Didnt even use it until my scalp was getting dried out, threw some of this in my hair and saw incredible results within days. This works great on everything and is pure enough to simply eat right outta the jar. Couldnt recommend it more"
792,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells so GOOD,"Just recently purchased this product, having never used it as a stand alone product.  Usually use products that contain coconut oil.  I found this to be a great moisturizer for both skin and hair, and it smells wonderful.  Both my young nieces use it for their skin and also love it.  One of my nieces thinks it smells like pound cake!  It is an oil though, so it's hard to use as a moisturizer right out of the jar, so I put it in a spray bottle.  Much better.  I recommend this for a good moisturizer."
793,B003B3OOPA,5,organic coconut oil,I love this product and use it in place of virgin olive oil for sauteing at high temperatures.<br />Also use a little on my skin: it's very moisturizing. I purchased it from Amazon.
794,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for natural hair care & great add for smoothies!,"Love this addition to my everyday health. This is my second hair journey after the BIG CHOP and my hair loves the coconut oil!! This a great moisturizer from head to toe. I also add a tablespoon to my Body by Vi shakes, which provides me more energy (much needed in the AM!). Love this!"
795,B003B3OOPA,5,best beauty product Iv'e ever used,"I just bought a second jar of coconut oil because I'm almost done with my first and I don't want to run on E. I use this as a skin moisturizer, hair deep conditioner, I sometimes eat a spoon from my fridge stack ( cuz it does taste good.) I love the smell  too. I even use it as a makeup remover and I use it as a lip balm mixed with Shea butter lips feels so smooth. I have people complement me on my skin tone and how smooth my skin is. I don't tell too many people about it because those who are not aware of any oil benefit automatically assumes its like corn oil or any other cooking oil and are put off by it.  Not me I've read plenty about it and I am never going without it again.  I haven't used used another brand of coconut oil but I will say that the best type is cold compressed coconut oil and organic extra virgin."
796,B003B3OOPA,5,I love this stuff!,"I really love coconut oil, I use it it seems for just about everything. I use it to make my toothpaste, as a moisturizer and a little bit in my hair. I also use it on my dogs dry skin. It's really great for your underarms because of the antibacterial properties it has. This is a cold pressed unrefined coconut oil meaning it smells & tastes like coconuts. I would highly recommend this product."
797,B003B3OOPA,5,Must Have!,I absolutely love this stuff! After seeing a pin on pinterest I origionally bought this for my face as a natural moisterizer. BUT I began eating this instead. This makes cinnamon and sugar toast AMAZING! I use this instead of butter in almost any recipe and it makes it healthier but still tastes great!
798,B003B3OOPA,5,Really moisturizes my skin,"I recently moved to Colorado, where it is always dry. Moisturizing body lotions alone just don't cut it for me. A friend introduced me to Nature's Way Coconut Oil and I fell in love. I mix it with my regular body lotion before applying it. My skin stays moisturized, feels baby soft, and does not feel oily. I have a problem with fragrances in general, and was at first worried about smelling like a coconut. However, that is not a problem at all; there is no scent. I've ordered this product twice so far and will continue to do so."
799,B003B3OOPA,5,"great quality, great price","Use it on my skin (face) to prevent dryness. Absorbs well into skin, doesn't cause breakout. Seems to be quite pure and delectable. I've tasted it as well and it seems fresh.<br /><br />Recommended."
800,B003B3OOPA,5,Surprise Surprise Surprise,"Nature's Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce<br />I have never used/eaten coconut oil before.  I read it was really good.  I thought I would give it a try when I bought a Whirley Pop.  This is so very good with making popcorn ... I add a little bit of butter too.  I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how good this taste.  I even eat small amounts right out of the jar.  I must say, not all coconut oil is the same.  I ran out so I bought more coconut oil at a local grocery store.  It is not the same, I am so disappointed.  The aroma isn't there.  I should have never wasted my money, and just came here to order more."
801,B003B3OOPA,5,great for scars,"This is the best cocnut oil i have used, after about 1 month i noticed significant results on my scar healing. This is a great product at a nice price."
802,B003B3OOPA,5,yummy - the real thing!,This is a great price for organic extra virgin coconut oil...I love the smell of fresh coconut and use it on my skin as a moisturizer and on all my cooking. awesome!
803,B003B3OOPA,5,I can't buy enough of this stuff. I use it for everything,"I got introduced to coconut oil about 1 year ago and i am crazy about the stuff. I use it for cooking to replace all other oils i used to use. I use it as a body lotion. I use it as a deep conditioner for my hair before getting in the shower. I mix it with baking soda to make a natural deodorant (that works every bit as good, if not better than anything you'd buy at the store.) It works as a massage oil. Basically, it's a miracle product that is useful in so many ways and is sooo good for you."
804,B003B3OOPA,5,Organic and Multi-Purpose,Extremely good product and versatile. I like Nature's Way and this is just another product I use daily. I use it for cooking and as a skincare product! Two for the price of one.
805,B003B3OOPA,5,Good Stuff,"Lots of uses, fried Chicken in it, tender and juicy, just a slight coconut flavor, not overwhelming, made the house smell awesome. I use it on my hair as a deep conditioner and also on dry skin in the winter."
806,B003B3OOPA,5,Good for so many things!!,"I originally purchased this product to use on my hair. It has made my hair healthier, stronger and softer. I also use it to pop popcorn. Gives it an excellent flavor- so much better than butter. And healthier. My puppy loves coconut oil too. Anytime I am in the bathroom conditioning my hair with it she will run in and beg for a bite. She's very healthy, has a beautiful coat and is energetic. I think this product is working well for both of us!!"
807,B003B3OOPA,5,great for everything.,"After hearing about all the amazing benefits for coconut oil, I decided to buy a jar. It works great on my hair when I put it in and let it stay overnight and wash it out in the morning, hair is healthier and doesn't break off.<br />It's great for my face and a lot better than the otc acne medication, the only thing about it is I can't put it on EVERY night or it'll redden and irritate my face. Every other night seems to work fine though.<br />And it's delicious and really helps with weight loss when eaten in very small amounts.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this stuff and would recommend it to everyone."
808,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent body cream!,"I was looking for castor and almond oil when I saw this product and after reading all the great reviews I ordered it to give it a try.<br />Just LOVE IT!!! It smells delicious and it is an excellend moisturizer. It has helped me in improving the dry skin in my elbows, my feet, atenuate the expression lines and help preventing stretch marks in my pregnant belly."
809,B003B3OOPA,4,Pleased,"Its real coconut oil. Mine is liquid all the time (it has being refined/ filtered). I had cooked/tasted coconut oil before. It smells really good, not overpowering. the taste is Ok, more on the light side. Have not mixed with food yet. I used it as hair/ body oil mixed with some shea butter, Its goooood. Just a little wont make it Oily. I'm pleased. It is what it advertises."
810,B003B3OOPA,5,Good for dry skin,"Delivery came on time. Nicely and safely packaged. Coconut oil came congealed. At warm temperature, it will liquidify.<br />Great for dry skin. Smells good too. Apply onto hair for silky smooth hair. I use it at night, leave it on, cover my pillow with a towel. Not sure about cooking, but I used as a salad dressing oil and it tasted yummy."
811,B003B3OOPA,5,great coconut oil!!!!!,"I got this coconut oil because my cousin told me about it and i love it!!! it's excellent to cook with or just to eat a teaspoon of it at a time, or to put in your hair for a treatment or to rub on your skin if it's too dry, this coconut oil helps sooooo much! It works great for me with my type2 diabetes and circulation problems i have in my legs! this stuff has really helped me get better!!!!!"
812,B003B3OOPA,5,very good coconut oil,"I bought this because coconut oil is good for body, and the smell is irresistible to me, it is so good flavor and we all like it."
813,B003B3OOPA,4,New to Me.,"I just started to use this produce, I like it better than butter on my bagels! I have some reciepts that calls for this now instead of oils or butter."
814,B003B3OOPA,5,im in love again,"i bought this particular oil because of the reviews and i have to say they were all right. my hair is shiny and looks healthy. i have medium long, curly hair that i let dry naturally and this oil its juts perfect. my sking is healthy and without any blemishes, definitely will buy again with subscribe and save."
815,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut oil for a variety of uses!,"Great price & nice oil, I use it for gargling; healthy gums. Also great for popping corn. The price was more reasonable compared to local discount stores."
816,B003B3OOPA,5,great for the skin,i bought this because i was looking for something that would help dry skin. this is the best stuff i have ever used and it softens skin very quickly. i will definately stick with this for my skin. works great for dry hair too.
817,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,this is the yes coconut oil ever will buy from here again. smells amazing and tastes really good and this stuff is very good for you!
818,B003B3OOPA,4,Coconut oil,"I use this to moisturize my hair, i love the smell its a good quantity so i know it will last for a long time. good product"
819,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this product!,"Just received my coconut oil today and I am over the moon excited about this product!!! It has so much versatility! I'm was going to just use it for my natural hair, but I decided to order another one today for the other health benefits! Fast shipping, always a plus! This product is a must have!!!"
820,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious Coconut Oil,The jar came in good shipping time and perfect order. I use this oil in cold cereal and hot coffee. It has a very mild coconut flavor and velvety smooth texture. It is not sweet at all but neutral. And from what I have read on the subject it is very good for you! I love all kind of coconut!
821,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing!!,I love coconut oil and this product is great the jar has a good opening so i can get the product with out it being messy. love love love it!! Great buy.
822,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product,Coconut Oil is supposed to be very good for you.  It has a great taste and I can see many meals using it to cook with.
823,B003B3OOPA,5,Bliss in a Jar,"First of all, the fragrance is subtle and heavenly and I love it. I noticed an immediate improvement in my skin. It's softer, and not just on the surface -- it feels healthier deep down and the tone is more even. I use it on my face as well. I prefer natural products, so I read up on the benefits of virgin coconut oil and then checked out the reviews here on Amazon. I completely agree with all of the positive things customers have written about this product. It's wonderful and has so many uses that are healthy and beneficial. It smells good, tastes good and feels good and I can't imagine being without it now. I'm hooked for good -- a lifer!"
824,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious and nutritious!,"I think this stuff is wonderful tasting, and it's very healthy too.  I'm also using it on a couple of dry patches on my skin (no, not in any weird places, folks) and it acts as a great moisturizer.<br /><br />I'm probably gonna buy about 100 more jars and put them in the underground shelter."
825,B003B3OOPA,5,great product,I am very impressed with this product my mother has alzheimer's and this product has brought her back from the brink. It has a lovely smell and the price is very good compard to the other brands
826,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product,I use this as a body lotion as well as in lip balm that I make.  It is consistently a good product.
827,B003B3OOPA,4,Great for protein treatment on hair,I use this oil in my hair as a hot oil treatment before i wash my hair. I leave it on for about an hour or at night when its washed out my hair feels a little dry but shiny. If you are protein sensitive i would not recommend using this but my hair loves protein so this is another products i will use for life. I don't use it on my scalp because my scalp starts to itch when its on my scalp so its only applied to the length on my hair.
828,B003B3OOPA,5,Lovely as a skin moisturizer!,I was trying to do a frugal birthday list for myself (total of all gifts less than $50) last September and decided to ask for this organic coconut oil.  My husband bought it for me and I have used it as a deep moisturizer about twice a week.  I can't describe the soul-satisfying scent or the elegant feel of rubbing this into my skin at night!  It's like eating an ice cream sundae without a single calorie...and the jar has lasted me almost 10 months! I highly recommend this coconut oil.
829,B003B3OOPA,5,Gold in a jar,"I use this primarily to prevent diaper rash on my son. We use cloth diapers and coconut oil is safe on them. Since buying the jar, I've used it to treat mild sunburns, cracked nipples, chapped lips, dry elbows, cradle cap... there isn't much coconut oil cannot moisturize!"
830,B003B3OOPA,4,Many uses,"I cook with this stuff, use it as butter, use it for oil pulling, on skin to heal a sunburn, a tiny amount to deal with flyaways and frizzy hair, I even shaved my legs with it last night. So smooth! The only thing I don't like about it for cooking (different container obviously) is that its almost TOO coconut-y. The health benefits are extraordinary, but it doesn't go over so well with everyone else when I use this to cook for them."
831,B003B3OOPA,4,"Great Item, but did not ship well.","I use this oil daily and get a subscription from AMZ. Normally it comes to my home ok. But in the summer, the oil turns from solid to liquid (above 78 F ambient), and sometimes the seal on the jar does not hold. This is what happened recently. AMZ happily replaced the shipment, but the real problem is with the manufacturer, who needs a more dependable seal."
832,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Healthy Oil,This is a great deal on coconut oil and a much better healthy alternative to regular cooking oils. Also great in smoothies.
833,B003B3OOPA,4,This stuff has so many different uses.,"This stuff has so many different uses for instance, I use it as a skin moisturizer and my ole lady uses it for her hair."
834,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells great,I used this product several times and it did make my hair smell and feel soft.be sure to put it in hot water before using it.<br />If you love the smell of coconut its a added plus.
835,B003B3OOPA,5,Nature's way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil,The product was received promptly.  The price was right and I will use this supplier in the future.  Great product to use.  I use one tablespoon of Coconut oil in unsweetened hot cocoa.  Great way to use this product for health.
836,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,"This is a great product.  I use coconut oil in almost all my cooking now, since it's so much healthier.  It's all organic, tastes great on everything.  A little goes a long way, and needs to be on low heat, it burns fast, so just be careful if you use high heat, it will burn up right away.<br /><br />I've been using it almost a year now, in all my cooking, and have it on subscribe and save about every 6 months.  It's fantastic.  I truly enjoy it."
837,B003B3OOPA,4,Good product,I like the smell and the consistency. It melts in your hands and you can apply it anywhere on your body. I don't feel that my skin is extra moisturized by this product.  But it's good.  I use it on my face before bed.
838,B003B3OOPA,5,Great stuff!,I use this for hair care and as a supplement. It works for me and my hair has been healtier since I've started using it. The health benefits are enormous and I can't wait to see results.
839,B003B3OOPA,5,Easy Does It...,I'm actually loving this multifuctional product. A little goes a long way so I'll probably get it every other month. I use it in my cooking & skin/hair care. I can't speak about all the benefits just yet because I've been only using the oil a little over a month. I'm happy thus far.
840,B003B3OOPA,5,The Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is great!!,The Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is great!! I apply the oil to my skin frequently. It is very good quality and it smells very good!! It is also good to eat!!
841,B003B3OOPA,5,Good Stuff!,I love this stuff.  I go through it so fast.  This is my favorite brand.  I like it better than Nutiva texture.  There are no particles in it.  Nutiva has small particles which is supposed to be completely normal and their may even been some benefits to it but I just prefer it without them. I absolutely HATE coconuts because of the texture so that is probably why it bothers me.Nutiva is still a good brand but this is better!
842,B003B3OOPA,5,The best there is...,"I have been using coconut oil as a body/face/hair moisturizer for about a year now and it has made all the difference in the world for my health. After doing a bit of research, I chose this product in particular due to the description, reviews, pricepoint, and the fact that it is a brand I have seen in many stores and am familiar with.<br /><br />The non-processed nature of this oil meets my skincare and haircare needs, but also makes it perfect for cooking as well. I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines."
843,B003B3OOPA,4,The body loves coconut oil,"I used this product on toast instead of butter, I used it to cook curry chicken. I used it to scramble eggs. I used it to flat iron my hair (smooth) i used it on my skin (mmm). Good vaginal lubricant too. Also great for oil pulling. I read it can be used with baking soda as a natural toothpaste? Haven't tried that one yet. This product is well worth the money for its many uses."
844,B003B3OOPA,5,Great healthy moisturizer,"I ordered this after having a facial where they used a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil and tamanu oil. My skin felt so wonderful, I had to try it for myself!  She recommended just getting coconut oil.  I actually really like that it solidifies so that I can just rub a little in my palms to heat it and apply it to my face & body.  It does feel a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely and my skin has never felt or looked better.  (I'm also using diluted apple cider vinegar as an astringent.)<br /><br />Now I need to try some of the other uses for coconut oil!"
845,B003B3OOPA,3,"great for my hair, but causes acne","Hello! am a 17 year old teenage girl and I bought product because I have very damaged hair from straightening. I also have mild acne.<br /><br />I am VERY satisfied with how my hair looks only after one deep conditioning treatment with this. You seriously only need about 1-2 teaspoon and my hair is about 1 and 1/2 feet long. My hair was SO soft! My sister eventually asked why I kept running my hands through my hair all day (I'm still doing it right now :D). And the reason for that is because it was softer and silkier, but MOSTLY it helped keep my hair tangle-free.<br /><br />Before I purchased this, I read some other reviews that claimed it was great for acne. I don't know why but it did not work for me. I only use a teeny bit on my face after a shower and the next day, I had a few whiteheads. At first I thought, ""well maybe its supposed to be like this before it gets any better"".. But it has been 5 days and it keeps getting worse. I am VERY disappointed. I don't know, maybe it is just my skin type.. I have dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />So overall, I give it a 5 for hair treatment and 1 for ""skin clearing""."
846,B003B3OOPA,5,Great moisturizer for hair and skin!,I love this product It is a great moisturizer for my hair as well as my skin. The smell is subtle but pleasing. I leave it in my hair overnight and it easily washes out in the morning. It also keeps my skin soft. It works very well for dry cracked heels. I just bought 2 more jars. I have not cooked with it!
847,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil user for Life,"I originally purchased this item because my mom has been using Coconut Oil for years and her skin is always so soft, smooth and flawless.  She told me she uses it on her hair and it worked wonders.  So after researching it's benefits on the internet I decided to purchase some.  This brand had the best reviews.  I used it as a leave in conditioner on my transistioning hair (I'm afro american) and it gave me a new head of soft hair!  My hair was damaged from dying my hair after a relaxer and it started breaking and shedding extremly bad.  After using the coconut oil one time my hair is moisturized all the way to my ends, no shedding, shiny, non greasy, and just plain beautiful.  I've also decided to use it in cooking too.  I HIGHLY recommend trying some, you won't regret it!! And it tastes and smells wonderful!!"
848,B003B3OOPA,5,Best extra virgin coconut oil I have used..,"I have tried many extra virgin coconut oil from wholefoods before, but this Naturesway product ranks as the best. Known for being a healthy dietary supplement, it also serves as multi-purpose."
849,B003B3OOPA,5,This is an awesome product,I only cook with this coconut oil.  It's wonderful and adds a delightful taste to veges.  I fry eggs in it. I fry steaks in it.  I saute veges in it. It's yummy and keeps perfectly on your kitchen counter.  It does not have to be refrigerated.  I will not be without this stuff in my kitchen.
850,B003B3OOPA,4,It conditions your hair.....and you can eat it too!,"In my never-ending search to find odd, unusual and inexpensive beauty products I have finally found ""COCONUT OIL""!!!<br /><br />I read a beauty book recently <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892349"">Can You Get Hooked on Lip Balm?: Top Cosmetic Scientists Answer Your Questions about the Lotions, Potions and Other Beauty Products You Use Every Day</a> that claimed that natural, organic, cold pressed coconut oil was the only oil that could actually penetrate the hair shaft. It seems all other oils, including mineral, olive, and sunflower can only coat the hair, at best a temporary cure.<br /><br />What makes coconut oil special? Its about 90% saturated fatty acid which contains about 40% lauric acid. Among it's almost mythical and magical properties it is ""reputed"" to cure a host of maladies including high cholesterol, obesity, infections,(all highly doubtful)and dry hair and skin (believable). It is also a food product that can be used as a butter substitute a shortening and a frying oil. My interest, however, is hair, just hair.<br /><br />Interestingly, coconut oil solidifies at temperatures under 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an air conditioned home in a temperate climate, this oil will be solid most of the time. I decanted a few teaspoons into a small container from the wide jar the product comes in. I keep the original container in the refrigerator and the small one in the bathroom where it is usually much warmer than the rest of my house.<br /><br />When liquefied, this oil is fairly thick and milky looking. It smells deliciously of coconut. To me it tastes of .... coconut grease....but not in a totally bad way.<br /><br />To use this as a hair conditioner one needs to start slowly and experiment. Although my hair is thick it has a fairly fine texture. The first few times I used the oil I over applied it and my hair became flat and greasy looking.<br /><br />As a hair conditioner, it is recommended to coat your dry hair and scalp with the oil, cover your head with a towel and let it penetrate for an hour or two. Using non-conditioning shampoo, apply a small amount to your dry hair and rub it in without adding any water at first. Then, after the shampoo has been rubbed in, add small amounts of warm water until you build up a lather. Rinse, then shampoo again normally. Your hair will be very soft and smooth.<br /><br />As a hair dressing, use only a very tiny amount unless your have thick, very curly or kinky hair. I gave a friend with long thick curly hair some of the oil and she is completely in love with it.<br /><br />A little of this product goes a very long way. A jar should last a very long time. Besides, if you don't like it as a hair product, you can always eat it!"
851,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this EVCO!,"I love organic coconut oil and feel it is a must in our diet. I just couldn't stomach the $16 price tag from Whole Foods anymore for the exact same product. I received it today, it has the exact same exp date on the package (I know that is an issue with some items on Amazon, products being too close to the exp date and maybe that is why you got it at a bargain price).<br />Came well packaged with the seal intact, no problems. I will buy it again from this seller. And with Amazon Prime, it makes it a super bargain!<br />Also, if you are doing your research on the many amazing properties coconut oil possesses, you know that it is anti-bacterial. I discovered almost 3 yrs ago that I was allergic to antiperspirant/deo. My armpits would itch and I would scratch them almost raw. When I stopped using anti/deo, the itch stopped. Looking around online, this happens to many people. What to do? Well, I went to Whole Foods and bought plenty of natural deos that did not work AT ALL! Good for me they take back anything, including used deo. I researched and found a recipe for coconut oil deo. It has cornstarch, baking soda, and coconut oil. I followed a recipe, (google coconut oil deodorant recipe) formed it into an old deo container, and what do you know? It works like a charm! NO ODOR! It does not stop sweat, but guess what folks? You are supposed to sweat under your armpits, it is your body's way of detoxifying itself. Sweat smells when the bacteria from the skin and the perspiration meet in a dark, warm place- the armpit. The EVCO inhibits the production of bacteria. You have a serious amount of lymph nodes there that need the freedom to move toxins out of your body. And we wonder why women get breast cancer more and more these days. When I have important social events or meeting I use a regular antiperspirant, but 90% of the time I use this. Keep in fridge in warmer climates, it melts at 76 degrees F.<br /><br />Coconut oil is truly amazing stuff, give it a try. Can't hurt."
852,B003B3OOPA,5,Best all around,"i eat it, use it in my hair, and use as a moisturizer. My skin seems smoother and wrinkles seem less noticeable.  I have extremely dry skin and this does not break me out.  My bf has really oily skin and it works great on him as well!  This coconut oil is amazing!!"
853,B003B3OOPA,5,After shower skin softener,"Right after showering, put a dab in palm. It starts to melt and then rub it in feet, legs, elbows, tops of hands...It is amazing. Real lasting moisturizing skin softener. And all natural. Smells great too."
854,B003B3OOPA,5,Great taste & perfect body lotion!,"This coconut oil is perfect for the cost.  Extra virgin? check! Organic? check! Unrefined, cold-pressed? check! So many uses, cooking, skin care, hair care, etc."
855,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Quality & nice price,I can not get EXtra virgin coconut oil around here. my stores simply do not carry it expect for the nutrician places which are high priced. I had tonsillitis and this was receommend on soothing the iratation involved. It worked wonderfully. the taste was good and the price was very reasonable for my area. Thank you
856,B003B3OOPA,5,I love it!!!,"It worked wonders on myhair! Its good right off the spoon, my dogs love it on their crunchy food that before they never wanted to eat! I also add it in my oatmeal. Also works wonders for feet massages! So many uses, went thru a whole bottle in probably 2 weeks because I love it so much!"
857,B003B3OOPA,5,Divine,"This Coconut Oil product is nothing short of amazing! It makes a delicious body moisturizer, a flavour enhancer over breakfast cerea or in hot chocolate for a ""coconutty"" flavour. Highly recommended."
858,B003B3OOPA,5,I enjoy the many uses of this product,I love coconut oil for everything. There are so many use for this. I use it for a hair and skin conditioner. I cook with it as a healthy oil not for flavor. It doesn't really have flavor. I love that it is organic and extra virgin. It was shipped promptly and it did not leak at all. It has a safety seal on it so it can't leak unless it was already opened or perhaps busted. I add this to my smoothies. It helps keep you regular if you use it on a daily basis. I will be ordeering this again. I like what this product do for me. I am on a weight management program and I use this as one of my tools to help me. You do not need to refrigerate this unless you want it solid. I store mine in the cabinet I don't mind it being an oil form.
859,B003B3OOPA,5,"Smells good, tastes good, moisturizes good","I've both cooked with this and used it as lotion and it has been exactly what I was looking for in both.  I've also used it as a leather conditioner treatment on my saddle and boots and it worked great for that as well.  It has a great nutty type of smell, I was concerned that when I cooked with it, it would be over powering but it wasn't."
860,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it.,I love coconut oil i use it for everything its so moisturizing and it has so many uses only around for me was the packaging coconut oil is in solid form but melts when heated so it should have been a zip lock or something since it did leak all over the box other then that love it.
861,B003B3OOPA,5,"Love, love, love.....","I love, love, love this product. The other coconut oil that I bought at a local super market taste like lard....yuck. This is creamy and a coconut lovers dream. If you want good tasting food and a great looking body and skin, get this product!!! You really can't go wrong!!!"
862,B003B3OOPA,5,Multi-use Product,"Great price if you suscribe. I use this product for cooking. It adds a light coconut flavor to less flavorful foods, like tofu. I also use it  on my skin, and I use it on my hair. It is a good moisturizer and does not leave my skin or my hair greasy. It is quite the versatile product. I have not seen all the benefits touted by advocates of coconut oil, but I've only been using the product for a month. I would  recommend this product for anyone wanting to try coconut oil."
863,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil is Great!,"I didn't know what to expect from this product.  Others speak of using it on their hair, skin, & etc...I chose to use it for cooking.  This Coconut Oil has to be the cleanest tasting, delicious product I have ever used to fry with.  I cannot eat foods that have a lot of grease, so this product is perfect for me.  It does not taste oily at all & the taste of your foods come through, not like other cooking oils.  I will absolutely continue to purchase more."
864,B003B3OOPA,4,#2 IN MY BOOK,"Excellent product for the price. One step lower in taste than my old brand, which I don't remember the name but costs 3 x's more."
865,B003B3OOPA,5,First try with virgin coconut oil,"I recently started with the coconut oil.  I tried the Louana product I got at the local Kroger.  No flavor, but it was a start.  After reading the various reviews, I thought I'd try this since this seemed such a reasonable price.<br />I am quite happy with it.  The coconut taste is fine and definitely different than the Louana, so I mixed the two to make it go further and make the Louana more flavorful and economize my use of coconut oil."
866,B003B3OOPA,4,good product,I think this is a good product.  I have been using it for my dogs allergies and have been putting a small amount on their food each day.  They love the taste.  They have severe skin allergies so hard to tell just yet if it's working but sure can't hurt.  I would recommend!
867,B003B3OOPA,5,Surprised by the coconut flavor!,"This is a great product just as all of the other reviewers have stated.  Much to my surprise, this tastes so much better than the other coconut oil that I bought regularly before.  This one has a much more coconutty taste.  Plus this one is Extra Virgin so it is healthier than the Expeller pressed that I used to buy.  Better price and better quality.  I love this coconut oil."
868,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,The coconut oil works great on my hair and skin. my hair responded great to the oil and it grew a little because of the oil.
869,B003B3OOPA,5,Great purchase,"I'm taking this product since last week (just 5 days until now) and will see the results soon. The flavor is good and the quality too, the delivery was ok."
870,B003B3OOPA,5,awesome stuff!!,I love coconut oil it is great for all sorts of stuff! I use it as a lotion and for oil pulling! This is a wonderful product!
871,B003B3OOPA,5,perfect,"This is by far the best coconut oil ever.....its so light,and melt right in your hands......I would most def. Recommond this coconut oil to anyone....I use it for my hair and it works great!!!"
872,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product,"I love this product. I bake with it and use it on my skin.  I have always had an issue with dry skin, but the Coconut Oil keeps my skin moisture all day. I especially love it on my natural hair, no more dry scalp. I have recommended this to most of my friends. Will buy more in the future."
873,B003B3OOPA,4,Very good for you!,"I know this is a great product. My chiropractor puts it on her toast!  You can also mix it with strawberry jam and use it on toast. It works extremely well as a hand cream, but it is hard and not creamy until you warm it up."
874,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for smoothies!!,"I bought this and another brand to try and both are equally as good.  I do like the clear container that this comes in though better so this is the brand I will stick with.  It comes in a clear plastic container and I don't notice any plastic taste as others have commented on coconut oil in general.  I just put a big spoonful in my magic bullet when I make smoothies!  So yummy!!  You can eat this straight out of the jar if you want to also.  It is good!  When I first got it (shipped in the winter), it was pretty firm and I had to scrape it with a spoon to get it out..like candle wax.  But once it warmed up a bit..just room temperature, it is very soft now.  It still is a solid though, but easier to work with.  It is similar to the inside of an Almond Joy candy bar at room temp.  I can't comment on health affects since I am a relatively healthy person with bloodwork that shows great results..so far, but am only 34 yrs old.  I love coconut and hope it can help with brain function, memory mostly..lol.  I hope if I start taking it now, it will help long term. Once I run out, I will be getting the largest jar for my money!  My husband and kids love the smoothies made with this! It's not overpowering either..just the perfect hint of coconut among the other fruit and veggies. I made mango, pineapple, banana, and coconut smoothies that were just awesome!! Even all blended up well, you can still see the tiny white coconut flakes within the smoothies. Just yummy!!"
875,B003B3OOPA,5,the best I have tried,"I use this coconut oil for cooking, face cream and as a nutritional supplement.<br />The quality is extraordinary! Once you try this you will not want any other coconut oil."
876,B003B3OOPA,5,great coconut oil,"this is a great product. excellent taste. great price and value. if you're looking for coconut oil to add MCT's to your diet, this is a great option."
877,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for hair and skin,I use this on my hair and on my skin after my bath or shower.  It is light so it doesn't weigh down your hair and gives your skin the moisture it needs without being greasy.  I've seen a big difference in my skin and my hair since using this over the last 4 months. Great product!
878,B003B3OOPA,5,Fantastic,"I love this product. I love the smell, the taste and the way I feel when I use this product. I try to use it in every way possible. I put it in my oatmeal for a satisfying,longlasting hunger satisfier. I also spread it on toast instead of butter. Yummy, what a treat and so healthy!"
879,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this,"We use this in place of a lotion for our 5 month old.  It is light, very moisturizing an has a subtle coconut smell, which is something that was missing from the last kind we tried."
880,B003B3OOPA,4,coconut oil health,"I found this product to be great for many different reasons. It can be used to soften hands, liven up hair and best of all is the rich flavor it gives your food when cooking with it. Your food tastes better and you don't feel weighed down like other oils make you feel."
881,B003B3OOPA,4,What can I say? It is what it is.,I don't use this for cooking really. I tend to use EVOO and grapeseed oil for that. However this works wonderfully for hair masks and as a supplement.
882,B003B3OOPA,5,Life saver !!,"I am so happy I found this product, I actually just ran out of my coconut oil that I ordered from a online site, so I was looking for something I could get my hands onto all the time. Great smell, and plenty to last me. Im natural, with a 4c hair type and this is the best for my hair along with other carrier oils or alone! Great plus that I got to use the free trial of amazon prime!! I will be buying this product again."
883,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome stuff,"This is so wonderful that I have to put it on the saver program with Amazon.  I use this for everything, from cooking to putting it on right after the shower to putting it in mine and my children's hair before I condition wash our hair.  I even put it in my Chai tea and it's wonderful on toast, infact it's so great that I don't need any other type of spread like mayo or anything, it's absolutely delicious.  My youngest doesn't like the smell but what does she know, she's only 9, everyone else in the house loves it.  My first jar lasted about a month, but I had to split some of it up so I'd have some in the bathroom and the rest in the kitchen.  I like that it doesn't liquify until you put in on your skin, it only liquified once(it was over 75 degress where I had it) and I put in the frig, however; when I took it out it was too hard.  You'll be very happy when you purchase this and needless to say it came very quickly, I'm on the prime membership so I rec'd it in 2 days.  I love it so much that I'm having a fit because I ran out. Just another note for this (3/12) this stuff cleared up my eczema, I mean it's gone and my skin glows."
884,B003B3OOPA,5,"WONDERFUL FLAVOR, SMELL AND CONSISTENCY",I had come across compelling reasons online to add this to my daily nutritional supplements so I bought this product and I have to tell you before I opened the jar I was skedish about downing a tablespoon of this stuff so I first added it to my oatmeal and it actually enhanced the flavor.  My next move was to allow it to liquefy and then I downed a tablespoon of it right out of the jar and I was delighted how wonderful it tasted.
885,B003B3OOPA,5,Great inside and out!!,"Simply put, I LOVE this stuff! I originally purchased it to replace butter in the kitchen. When I broke it open I was taken in by the smell...it was amazing. I was a little concerned because it smelled kinda sweet, so I wasn't certain if it would alter the taste of my savory dishes. It made them taste better than butter ever did! After doing a little more research I found there are SOOOO many other beneficial uses. So, I have taken to using it on my hair and skin. In fact, I had a little eczema episode on my wrist that the coconut oil healed in less than a week and it has not returned. Highly recommended."
886,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I can't say enough about this wonderful product, and the amazing properties that it has... I use it in my oatmeal every morning, spread it on toast, cook with it, and use it on my skin. I began using it in Jan. of this year, after viewing the ""Alzheimers"" videos on F/B.<br />I put one tablespoon in my oatmeal everyday, as well as using it as a spread, etc.<br />My energy level is definitely elevated,and my skin is like silk..<br />Lots of potitives with this product."
887,B003B3OOPA,5,Solid in the jar but starts melting in your hands!!!,This is really a fantastic product. Ordered it for my hair. I have fine brunette chemically treated hair. Doing wonders for my hair and my skin.<br /> I love how it looks so solid in the jar but starts melting in your hands. It also does not run down your neck like the olive oil does!<br />It is a massive jar which can last years and I love the smell!
888,B003B3OOPA,5,Great natural coconut oil,"I am using this for both health benefits (consumption) and for cosmetic purposes (application.) The product arrived on time in perfect condition. It tastes wonderful, feels great on my skin and has a very pleasant aroma. Everything that I ordered arrived very quickly and was packaged altogether because I used the free Super Saving shipping option. Fantastic! Overall, I am pleased with this product as it is the healthiest coconut oil that I could find without paying exorbitant prices. Thanks!"
889,B003B3OOPA,5,Great item has many uses,"Great item has many uses! I use it in my hair, on my body as a moisturizer, in my food and also as a supplement. It's the best and for a very good price."
890,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!,"I love this coconut oil! I use it on my body, face, and hair. It also smells and tastes delicious. I can eat it plain, but one of my favorite ways to eat it is with some mini chocolate chips sprinkled over a spoonful of it. Yum! I also like to cook french toast in it and top my sweet potatoes with it. My only complaint is that it's a little grainy. I don't notice it so much when I eat it, but I do when I'm using it as a moisturizer. It's not that big of a deal though. And to be fair, this is the only coconut oil I have ever bought so I can't compare it to any other brands. I love it so much, though, that I have no reason to try any other brands."
891,B003B3OOPA,4,Skin Softener,Really softens the skin and works well in the summer.  I mix this with Shea butter often for optimal results.  I also add some to a nice bath and it really does wonders on the skin.
892,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing product!,"This is an excellent product. I use it as a body moisturizer, my daughter uses it on her hair and I have also used it for cooking! It has a very delicate fragrance (even my boys thought it smelled nice). The taste is very mild and slightly sweet -- great for cooking. It is very hard but quickly softens in your hand. Amazing product! I am ordering more as a gift for family members who don't like all the chemicals in lotions!"
893,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product!,This organic coconut oil was exactly what I hoped it would be.  I use it for my very dry skin and it really does the trick!
894,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious!,"Very fresh oil with a creamy coconut flavor that melts on your tongue.  Solid at room temperature, but liquifies quickly.  I use it as a lotion and for my hair, nutritional supplement, occasional eye makeup remover, and sometime drinking chocolate mix-in.  Also used it in my morning smoothie, with frozen pineapples and milk, to make a pina colada-style drink."
895,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Coconut Oil,"I love this coconut oil it is everything I was hoping for and then some! I use it for my hair and face and wow. I have frizzy, dry, curly hair and since I've been using the coconut oil my hair is smooth, straight and dandruff free!! I've had a horrible experience with an acne treatment and burned my eye sockets and the coconut oil has restored them back to normal and even made a few improvement because I see less wrinkles. I wanted to use this for my high cholesterol but have yet to start taking it as a supplement. From tomorrow on I will. =) Great buy, try it!"
896,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome Stuff!!,"This stuff is a GREAT moisturizer!!! All natural and coconut oil has a natural sunscreen!! Smells great, absorbs well. I use it on my face and Im not greasy at the end of the day. Great for all over body! Rough elbows, feet, wonderful on hands! Truly a great product!"
897,B003B3OOPA,5,"Ease into if you're not used to it, pure quality product","You can taste the coconut. It's slightly sweet. I took about a generous tablespoon in my first ingestion attempt. Mind you, I've previously used other coconut oils before, but I would have to say the were greatly inferior to this product.<br /> I felt ill to the stomach within 30-45 minutes of consuming the tablespoon...I did what every American does, I googled. Turns out that it's common for those who have an overabundance of yeast in the system.  I drink tons of beer, well Belgian wheat ale to be exact, and the coconut oil reportedly acts as a detox according to some holistic opinions. I'm willing to give it a  further try. I think it's best that you ease into coconut oil therapy vice gobbling a juicy tablespoon of it. I will update this review in a few months, but few on people  on Amazon report experiencing any malaise from consuming coconut oil and I had to do a quick search to learn how common it is.<br />Otherwise, I concur that this is a superior product and if any true benefit would be redeemed from ingesting coconut oil, this would be one of the key ones to try."
898,B003B3OOPA,4,Dotties Coconut Oil,"This is a good & refreshing product. You don't need much to use in a fry pan, But the only thing I noticed is that it is like wax.  I thought it w/be like how it is explaned on page, ""An Oil"" ~ Oils pour out, and this doesn't ~ you have to use a knife or hard spoon to get out.<br /><br />BUT, I MUST TELL YOU ~ I did like how it tastes as long as it's cooked w/something.  I broke up pieces of 1 flour tortilla in just a regular frypan frying till I liked it ~ chrunchy crisp.  Then put on paper towel to absorb any extra oil, then powdered......Mmmm, it hit the spot.  It made such a simple item into a great tasting snack for my cravings.  Haven't used long enough to tell if it's a energy booster.  ALL IN ALL, EXCEPT FOR THE WAXINESS OF IT, IT DOES FRY THINGS GOOD.<br /><br />DOTTIE T., ERIE"
899,B003B3OOPA,5,great coconut oil,"feels great, smells great and tastes great.  pure and heavy.  cook<br />with it, spread it on your skin and enjoy it."
900,B003B3OOPA,5,Great multi purpose product,"I purchased this coconut oil to use on my dry skin and to make my own facial wipes. Coconut is a natural antibacterial agent, so it's perfect for a facial wipe. The smell is great, very mild coconut smell, it's a great moisturizer, I use it as a hair treatment - the only thing I haven't done is use it as a supplement but at this price you could do so easily!"
901,B003B3OOPA,4,Its ok,I purchased this product for my daughter's hair because it was getting dry I'm not sstisfied for it with the hair but its great for the skin.
902,B003B3OOPA,4,coconut oil,"I purchased this product for moisturing and body rubs,(massages). It works well as both, does not stain clothing because the melting point is lower then skin temperature. The only thing I do not like is the odor is stronger then I like."
903,B003B3OOPA,5,Great coconut oil,"This is a great coconut oil.  It tastes good and is very good used in cooking. i will order again.  I take a tablespoon every morning and also cook with it.<br /><br />I am diabetic and have awful dry skin.  Coconut oil is wonderful for skin, hair, fact. etc."
904,B003B3OOPA,5,Heavenly,"I've used this as a moisturizer for my scalp and for my body for a little over 1 month now. It has stopped my scalp from becoming dry and flaky like it used to do, yet it's light enough to not make my hair greasy (I have relaxed hair with the usual ""new growth""). This makes my skin feel soft and absorbs pretty easily, especially after the shower. I also love the light coconut scent."
905,B003B3OOPA,5,"Great for skin, so moisturizing!","I got this because I read on a forum I frequent that it helps with ""chicken skin,"" which I have unfortunately carried over from my teenage years. ""Don't worry about it,"" my parents would assure me, ""that goes away when you get older."" No, mom, I don't think so. I'm in my 20s and still have rough skin on the back of my arms and it's not fun. I've tried $50 creams, exfoliating scrubs, etc. from high end brands, and nothing has ever really worked. I've only used this a couple of times and I already feel a huge difference. I just use it right after the shower and it absorbs into my skin wonderfully. I liked it so much after using it the first time, that I used it on my legs, hands, etc. and my skin everywhere is softer than it has ever been. I even tried it on razor burn(I get the WORST razor burn), and it really helped soothe it overnight. I usually buy products for specific uses and this is my first time trying something completely natural on my skin, but I'm so glad I did. Try it, it's so much more worth it than all the more expensive, chemical-filled products out there!"
906,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil is good for almost EVERYTHING!,"This stuff is amazing, I'm so glad I discovered it.<br />I originally purchased it for my dog after reading that it's good for them.<br />His coat is amazingly soft and shiny (I am also giving him humic minerals, so that's not all just the coconut oil).<br />After I developed a horrible case of Candida, I started using this for everything!<br /><br />The candida is making my hands and feet unbearably itchy, and my mouth developed oral thrush (red and inflamed under my tongue with white spots) Putting the coconut oil on my feet followed by a couple pairs of socks, completely stops the itching.<br />And after putting coconut oil and occasionally plain yogurt under my tongue for about three days the thrush is almost completely gone.<br />I have noticeably more energy after using the coconut oil for food and such for a few days in a row."
907,B003B3OOPA,5,I love this!,"I use this all the time. I fry eggs, put on bread instead of butter and use it on my skin. I love the taste and smell. Absorbs well into the skin."
908,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this stuff,"This is the best tasting oil I've used.<br /><br />Try reading the ""coconut oil miracle"" book.<br /><br />You will learn why soy and so many other oils have been replaced in processed foods and how that has helped to increase so many of today's diseases and illnesses...<br /><br />Medium chain fatty acids are the key, like that in coconut oil... they do not go rancid and oxidize when exposed to heat, air or light as vegetable oils do due to their much higher heat capacity.<br /><br />Plus, amazon sells is cheaper than the markets...as much as 50% cheaper..."
909,B003B3OOPA,5,EXCELLENT!!,"I tasted 2 diff organic oils and this tasted better and more rich in flavor. At first I was grossed out cuz it reminded me of bacon grease, as I saw other reviews mentioning that =P After a couple bites in one setting, I developed a taste for it. I decided to make eggs for my dogs, myself, and my son and they were WEIRD BUT DELICIOUS. I will try sneaking this into my fiancee's food to see if he can taste a difference. What's weird is I felt full instantly and usually I eat alot so I can see where this is a good staple to my diet in losing excess weight =)"
910,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome!!!,I love this oil... I mostly use it for my natural hair and it works wonders.. I have used it for my skin as well.. I'm not really a fan of the smell of coconut in general but this isn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be... Overall a great buy..
911,B003B3OOPA,5,very happy,"i read a lot about this stuff, this was the best priced option available to me, i like the hint of coconut it leaves on foods i cook with (very light hint but doesnt interfere with the taste of the food), if you dont like coconut at all, you wont like this. i also drop a tiny bit in my dogs food, since its is very healthy for me and them as well (good for their coats). i even spread some of this on a peanut butter sandwich.. thats a fatty sammich but yummy! :)"
912,B003B3OOPA,5,Great buy!,Pros:<br />+cheap!<br />+all natural and cold pressed!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-taste might be an issue for some but not because of brand<br /><br />***** 5x star product!
913,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious and Nutritious!!!!,"This coconut oil tastes just like eating sweetened flake coconut in a liquid form! It has a wonderful mild flavor that goes brilliantly in both savory and sweet dishes. Just this morning, I poured a teaspoon on some cold cantaloupe and it was just fabulous!!! Can't beat the nutritional benefits of coconut oil with a better tasting product!"
914,B003B3OOPA,5,Great,"I like this product, the price, and the shipping time. I have already recommended it for family and will continue to buy it in the future."
915,B003B3OOPA,5,Great skin conditioner,"This coconut oil replaced my skin conditioner and lotions.  Smells good, moisturizes my skin, and is all-natural.  Last week I tried to order more, but they no longer have their free shipping, so I will be choosing a different brand of coconut oil, or buying directly from the store."
916,B003B3OOPA,5,Works well,"Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The extreme heat made the oil into a liquid form upon arrival. After letting it sit, it turned back into it's normal consistently. I used for my hair as I transition from a relaxer to a normal state. Haven't used to cook at all. It's a great addiion to my collection of hair products. Natural hairdresser said to use when hair is in natural state ONLY. Do not use when applying heat since the product is a 'heavy'."
917,B003B3OOPA,5,Good product quickly delivered.,I used the coconut oil as a substitute for butter in one of my favorite cookie recipes.  It worked well and made a somewhat healthy recipe even healthier.
918,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells and Tastes Amazing,The first thing I noticed about this brand of Coconut Oil was the smell. It is so sweet it made me want to start eating it right away. I use Coconut oil for baking and also as a moisturizer. I have not been disappointed at all with this brand.
919,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product with many uses.,"I bought this because I have eczema and I read coconut oil could help keep skin moist and prevent flare-ups.  I also knew it was a delicious choice for cooking and baking.  With both those applications and the effect I get when I use it on my hair as a pre-shampoo moisturizing treatment, it's really great.  I bought this brand at the store, really liked it, read reviews of it and others, and decided the lovely smell, the smooth texture and the subtle taste were ideal.  It's a great product and I recommend it to people all the time."
920,B003B3OOPA,5,excellent flavor,I enjoy mixing agave nectar with this coconut oil and using it as a dip for fruit & nuts! What a yummy nutritious treat!
921,B003B3OOPA,5,"Very fresh, great quality",Ordered these to try them out and I must say this product is top notch. The oil smells and tastes like coconuts and it just appears of high quality. It gives some dishes a slight hint of coconut when used in cooking. I love this stuff. Will definitely keep ordering.
922,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells Really Good,"I've been using this product for a year now and I want to say that it smells really good.  I use it to seal moisture in my hair.  I read on the package that you can also cook with it.  I haven't tried that yet, but it smells good enough to cook with.  I worried about the oil becoming solid in cooler temperatures, but surprisingly it stays liquified no matter what temperature.  It's not greasy at all... very light and coats the hair shaft well.  I highly recommend!"
923,B003B3OOPA,5,wonderful,this is one of the best flavored coconut oils ive found so far. very light .. nice value also.. highly recomend this brand
924,B003B3OOPA,5,Best coconut oil for whatever purpose,"I've literally tried over 3 different coconut oils for my hair and this bh far is the best. It smells good, the texture is shiny and pure, and the cost is pretty good. This is excellent for hair( even black hair). Since I've been using this I have been able to retain my lenght."
925,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells great,This is a amazing coconut oil its 100% real coconut oil which is good and it smells light and crisp yum! I use it in my hair every night and its so smooth and shiny
926,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent Oil,"This Coconut oil has excellent flavor and consistency, I recently seared a couple of pounds of Ahi tuna in it and it was the best I have ever eaten."
927,B003B3OOPA,4,Excellent Product!,"My hair gets very soft and shine wit this oil. The only negative is that your hair will get stiff in cold weather when using it. Other than that, I love it!!"
928,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent,"Unlike other coconut oils, this oil has a very nice coconut fragrance that permeates the food as well giving a very pleasant taste."
929,B003B3OOPA,5,Fantastic Oil option,"I was looking for a healthy alternative to olive oil, this was, compared to Whole Foods prices, a GREAT deal. And coconut oil had been recommended to me by 2 separate friends that are amazing cooks and very very healthy people.  We made stir fry with it and won't go back to regular cooking oil, incredibly flavorful and I would say ""gourmet"".  There are instructions that this oil is meant for temperatures 350 and under. Baked a white birthday cake at 350 degrees with this oil and the cake had a great coconut flavor but came out drier.  But kids still devoured it.  Came super fast via mail, and a friend was right in recommending me buying this on Amazon vs. the store."
930,B003B3OOPA,5,So many uses for this!,"I use it for everything really...from cooking, to skin moisturizing, to hair balm. Works great! Even my pets love it."
931,B003B3OOPA,5,Great,"I use coconut oil in whatever I cook.  I also use it as a substitute for shortening in pie crusts, biscuits, etc.  It's consistency is close to shortening at room temperature."
932,B003B3OOPA,5,Fabulous!,I love this and a far better price than other stores. It has so many uses....but as a body lotion you can't beat it!
933,B003B3OOPA,5,"Great product.  Terrific for popcorn, and very healthy.",I can't say enough good about this product.  Love the taste.  Love the quality.  Outstanding for cooking and imparts a subtle coconut flavor.  The only con is that it can generally be bought for around $5.00 - $6.00 on special at the supermarket. Regular price is about the same.
934,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful Product with Endless Applications,"I love raw organic unprocessed coconut oil and this brand I use quite often - both for sauteeing or just 'taking a swig' in the morning with a piece of toast (a version of dipping the bread into olive oil).  I live in pretty warm climate, so most of the time it maintains runny consistency.  In the winter it gets solid, but still very easy to work with.<br />I use it to make my own homemade chocolate (without white sugar) and with great results.<br /><br />I also make my own skin moisturizer with shea butter, argan oil, avocado and coconut oil and couple of drops of lavender oil.  It feels and works spectacular both on the skin or tiny amount on the hair.<br /><br />It's just all around marvelous product and if you have not yet, definitely try it!!"
935,B003B3OOPA,5,Great For Cooking and Moisturizing,"I really like this product after having used it for the last 3 months as a substitute for both my cooking oil to reduce my fat intake and my assorted moisturizing products for my skin and hair.  I love the smell of the product while cooking and it does give the foods you cook with it a nice taste; I especially like cooking my chicken with it.  I have been using it on my hair and have noticed that my hair has a sheen and weight to it which I used to have in my younger days.  So far, so good..."
936,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent!,"I take 1 spoonful of the coconut oil every day, my nails and hair are growing stronger and fast. my skin looks shiny.  The smell is wonderful, good taste. I even use it as a deodorant. It deserves 6 stars. I will recomend 200%."
937,B003B3OOPA,5,smooth and rejuvenating,"I am not a huge fan of coconut oil but after my first baby I decided to ol my body before shower just to get some relief from body aches and tension. I tried parachute coconut oil that is pretty famous in India but then I realized that it did not suck that well into my skin so I decided to check Amazon for coconut oil and came across this product that has 5 stars. I decided to give it a try and within two uses I became a huge fan. This oil does not take time to penetrate skin and I felt so good after my shower. I am totally in love with this product and plan to use it for many more years. Love, love, love it. Yet to use it in food but will surely give it a try since it smells so fresh and good!"
938,B003B3OOPA,4,Although it's a great product... it has increased from $8.32 to $14.99!!!,"I had to write something about it and let others know about the price increase...<br />""Nature's Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce has increased from $8.32 to $14.99."" I guess there's coconut shortage."
939,B003B3OOPA,5,"Very good product, but a 60% price increase in a week?","I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Amazon's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).<br /><br />All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.<br /><br />One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".<br /><br />OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).<br /><br />PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.<br /><br />PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions."
940,B003B3OOPA,2,Bleck the taste!,"I buy and use coconut oil often.  I use it to cook with, spread on various foods, take it for my health, use on my skin and hair; kind of a coconut oil junkie.  I bought this to try thinking it was better bang for my buck.  It works well on my skin and hair but in my humble opinion the taste is terrible.  I much prefer the taste of Coconut Pacific 100% Pure Organic Extra Virgin Raw Coconut Oil.  I hope Coconut Pacific's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DHM8S"">Coconut Oil Extra Virgin Organic 14 Oz - Noni Pacific</a> will come back into stock soon as I mainly use Coconut Oil and Olive Oil for day to day cooking.<br /><br />So, if you are seeking coconut oil for your health where you eat up to a tablespoon a day - do not buy this as you will never get it down.<br /><br />If you are only looking to use on your hair and skin this should be okay."
941,B003B3OOPA,5,ONE OF MY FAVS!!,"THIS OIL LEAVES MY HAIR VERY MOISTERIZED, MY HAIR IS HEALTHIER, I DEEP CONDITION WITH THIS AND SEAL WITH IT AS WELL. THE BEST ON THE PLANET FOR SURE!"
942,B003B3OOPA,3,Disappointed,"I tried this for my hair and skin.  It didn't absorb into either one.  I wore it on my hair for three hours and had to wash my hair three times to get it out.  I had it on my skin for three or four hours also and it never absorbed in, I had to wipe it off.  I didn't see a difference in my hair or skin afterwards either.  Disappointed to say the least."
943,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil for Everything,Are you kidding me?  I can't even begin to list all of the ways I use this amazing coconut oil.  It would be easier to list what it is NOT good for.  Let me think....uh....nothing.
944,B003B3OOPA,5,"YUM, YUM, YUM!","This product is definately YUM.........no, I don't eat it, it just smells so wonderful!<br />Although it says ""coconut oil,"" this product absorbs into your skin so quickly<br />and thoroughly, it is not at all greasy.  This is the first product that my extremely<br />dry cuticles respond to - it leaves them conditioned and my hands very soft. And<br />FINALLY  I have found a product that eliminates the dried skin on my legs!  (Ladies,<br />you know what I'm talking about)  I will most definately order this  product again<br />and from this highly recommended seller."
945,B003B3OOPA,4,Good Stuff,"This product smells great, tastes great, and absorbs well. I'd prefer a glass container instead of a plastic one though."
946,B003B3OOPA,5,MIRACLE NATURAL PRODUCT,"I've had the worst eczema for years. My skin will fall off my pillow and pile up that's how bad it was.<br /><br />I've tried so many things from lotions, cetaphil, cosmetics, steroid creams, olive oil. All these things made my skin worst. This product immediately soothed my dry skin and didn't feel uncomfortable. I've super-sensitive skin and it didn't irritate me at the slightest and it doesn't have unneccessary ingredients like alcohol which dry and sting your skin.(I just don't understand how products get away with that.)<br /><br />Also, I heard there's a bunch of antioxidants and apparently it can even help people with aids, my skin looks years younger and I don't feel bizarre anymore whenever people walk my way or make eye-contact with me.  I believe if more people knew about this cosmetic companies would run out of business, this is truly a miracle natural product."
947,B003B3OOPA,4,Great product but ships poorly,"Overall, I am very happy with this product.  It smells great.  My only issue was in shipping.  With hot summer weather, the coconut oil turned into a liquid state and leaked out of the sealed container soaking everything else I ordered from amazon.  Thankfully it was nothing I couldn't clean up.  Just keep that in mind when ordering with other items."
948,B003B3OOPA,5,I love Coconut OIl,"Coconut oil is awesome!! I have found the organic coconut oil is even better. It has many uses in my household. I use it on my hair, and skin, and I added it to my smoothies!!! You can go wrong with coconut oil especially this brand!"
949,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product!,"I have heard wonderful things about coconut oil over the last few years and stumbled upon this one as I was browsing Amazon one day. I have been using it on my feet, as I have very dry heels, and then I put socks on for a little while. It has done very well with moisturizing my feet and making them soft. It's great!"
950,B003B3OOPA,5,it so good to my hair,first of all i had dreads for 5 long years be for i spent 5 days taken them out and after i did that my hair was so bad tell i got this and im so in love with my hair and i im black with very course thick hair im really just soooooooooooooo happy to have beautiful long hair
951,B003B3OOPA,5,"good price, great for African American hair, curly hair","I bought two of this product since I thought the price was good.  My daughter has African-American hair that is relaxed and dry, so the combo of coconut oil and olive oil (roughly 1/2 tablespoon each), mixed with about 1/4 cup Silk Elements conditioner (from Sally's beauty supply), or any favorite conditioner, really makes a big difference for her dry hair.  Wash out the mixed conditioner, and hair is soft but not oily.  My other daughter has very curly, frizzy hair, and it works well for her hair as well without feeling greasy."
952,B003B3OOPA,5,My hair is in love!,"I had been looking for something to help minimize my hair shedding during my transition period from relaxed hair to natural hair.  I have not tried other brands, but after using this brand of coconut oil I'm hooked.  I also used it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.  No more lotions full of chemicals for me!!"
953,B003B3OOPA,5,Great moisturizer for natural hair (african american),I recently transitioned from permed to natural hair and use this prodcut to moisturize my teeny weeny afro. I love it and it smells great!
954,B003B3OOPA,5,A health Miracle in a Jar,"I love this stuff. It is delicious. It is solid at room temperature but I prefer it in liquid form which I achieve by running the jar under hot water. I take 1 tbsp about 3-4 times a day and use this as a moisturizer after the shower. It tastes yummy but I did have to get used to the feeling that I was swallowing oil. My hubby had no problem w this and even joked it was so good that he could drink it with a straw. I have suffered w a systemic yeast infection for years which has caused numerous skin problems and a nasty white tongue. This has cleared that up in a week. The pimples I had on my arms and thighs are gone and so are my undereye dark circles. My nails are growing smoothly and my hair stopped falling out when I brush. I also started using it as a vaginal moisturizer and I am extremely pleased with the results. I also noticed how it helped with my cold. My symptoms were mild whereas everyone else had a more severe reaction. It also helped with my cracking feet and my pinky toe, which has been blackened forever, is returning to normal. I love using it on the kids lips because I know when they lick it off it's not harmful. My hubby started taking it as well when he saw how I benefited and he loves the natural burst of energy he gets after. My daughter finally tried some and now loves it on her madelines in the morning. I cant say enough wonderful things about this product. I feel like a brand new person. I wish doctors knew more to recommend this instead of blaming loss of energy and skin problems on aging. This is healthy for you, gives you energy, aids in weight loss and kills bacterias, yeasts and fungus. First magazine just wrote an article on the benefits of adding coconut oil to your diet in their January issue. It's so good that I'm going to subscribe to it.<br />UPDATE: I still LOVE this product and use it daily. I've found it makes the best pancakes when you grease the griddle w some. It is an excellent wood cleaner and the only way I clean wood, now. I also make a lip scrub w a drop of coconut oil in the palm of my kids' hands and a pinch of sugar. They love how yummy it is, I don't worry if they get it in their mouths, and they no longer have dry, cracking winter lips. My youngest has been using it nightly, after her bath, and the excema that plagues her legs, hasn't returned w the dry, cold air. This has become one of the most used products in my home."
955,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful Product,"Recently, I wanted to ""up the ante"" on my Omega fatty acids so I added Coconut oil to go along with my doses of flaxseed oil and fish oil. Yes, Coconut Oil is a saturated fat, but because it's a medium chain tryclyceride (MCT), it's more easily absorbed by the body and converted into energy, not stored on the body as fat. This product has a nice flavor--I use it in cooking and it doesn't depart any heavy ""coconut"" flavor. Sometimes I just eat a tablespoon. The benefits are tremendous: microbial properties, helps thyroid, liver, pancreas, bones, skin, soothes the digestive tract. The list goes on.<br /><br />I bought one jar for the kitchen and one jar for my bathroom. This product is great to put on right after a bath or shower. Yes it's a bit greasy at first, but rub it in well and let it absorb, then wipe off the excess with a damp towel or wash cloth. Your skin will be satiny smooth.<br /><br />Bonus tip: I give a teaspoon to my dog every day. Studies show dogs' prefrontal brains benefit from this wonder fat."
956,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful taste,"I got this particular oil to combat the damage from a H Pylori stomach infection, as well as get some good fats in me. First of all - this is an incredibly fresh GREAT TASTING product. I can eat spoonfuls of it right out of the jar. (with some chocolate ovaltine - it taste just like 'Almond Joy').  The wide mouth of the jar makes it easy to get to the product without melting it first.  The jar is made of plastic, but you can easily transfer the product to a glass mason jar - if you  want to."
957,B003B3OOPA,5,This is the stuff!,"I am a total coconut oil convert.  I may even be a zealot.  My daughter has very dry type 3C-4A hair, and since I started using the coconut oil on her hair, it has become much more supple and shiny.  Less frizz in the mornings, easier to braid and comb, etc. I have thrown out all the traditional mainstream haircare products in favor of this.  They don't even compare.<br /><br />Moreover, I use it as a body/facial moisturizer and it is magnificent. A little goes a long way and my skin stays smooth all day.  Love it."
958,B003B3OOPA,5,EfaGold Coconut oil,"ordered this for face moisturizer as my skin is quite sensitive. I was looking for a natural and inexpensive product and this sounded like a good thing to try.  I have been very happy with it.  A small bit on my face after showering feels wonderful.  I am also trying it on fungused toenails as supposedly it has some antibacterial properties.  Too soon to know yet if that works.<br /><br />Also, it smells heavenly.  Love it!"
959,B003B3OOPA,5,Can't Do Without It,"I love this coconut oil.  It is the best makeup remover ever!  Yes, it even removes the waterproof mascara.  It is great for internal and external use.  I can't do without it!"
960,B003B3OOPA,5,great,"grea t product i have been searching for extra virgin organic coconut oil.And i couldnt find it anywhere.so i went to walmart and bought this bottle of blue magic coconut oil and i was happy.until i read the label,it had petrolatum in it. i harmful chemical that damages the hair and stops it from growing. i was so upset. so i found some organic virgin coconut oil and then decied to order it.i wish it would of costed a litle less but its okay.and guess what you can use this coconut oil in baking as a subsitute for butter,shortening,and margarine.you can also use it on your hair and skin.and you can take it daily for a dietary suplement. great product!"
961,B003B3OOPA,4,Anxious to Test Long Term Benefits,"Received my Coconut Oil yesterday, opened immediately for a taste.<br /><br />1. Pulled off the safety seal and the aroma of fresh coconut wafted out-very pleasant<br /><br />2. Took a teeny, tiny bit of the ""oil"" (it's a solid) for a taste. With the aroma, your mind sets you up for MOUNDS...it is NOT.  It's very subtle and not at all sweet and it melts on your tongue faster than butter.<br /><br />3. I toasted a waffle to give it a real test---Most excellent, a hint of coconut and I added a dab of berry preserves....very good.  I have a friend who sautees shrimp in it and serves with a mango salsa---now doesn't that sound GOOD!<br /><br />4. I proceeded to put a small dab on the back of one hand and I do mean SMALL---VERY small...rubbed the BACKS of my hands together to liquify and then distributed over my hands and lower arms.  The dab was so small it was almost not ""there"".  My hands were so smooth it was amazing.<br /><br />More testing to begin on the long term benefits - right now - very happy<br /><br />** Update - one of the major reasons for purchasing this product are the multitude of health benefits for consuming coconut oil---I just discovered one that is ADDICTIVE.<br />Keebler makes a new wheatable NutCrisp small cracker: Crunchy Cashew...a little dollop on a cracker and it is absolutely heaven---you can easily get your 3 (recommended) tablespoons a day"
962,B003B3OOPA,5,Best thing for diaper rash prevention!,"Coconut oil is *fantastic* at preventing and treating diaper rash.  Whenever my daughters bum starts to get a little red, a little dab of coconut oil heals it by the next diaper change.  It works to get rid of diaper rash, too."
963,B003B3OOPA,5,Ezcema Treatment,My 7 mo old had ezcema from our laundry detergent...a little coconut oil healed him right up!  I even blogged about it while doing research...here's my link if you'd like to read more. [...]
964,B003B3OOPA,5,Great taste,"This product is great.  My husband and I both love it.  It is good as a supplement, and for cooking.  It has a wonderful scent and a soft taste.  It is a very healthy product.  We are pleased."
965,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product!,"This is a right one I have expected. My hair feel so smooth and shiny after 2 weeks I use it. But you should wash your hair clean completely by shampoo, if not your hair feel sticky and will be dirty soon."
966,B003B3OOPA,5,Just what I expected,"This is my first time trying coconut oil.  I was happy that the oil has a very mild flavor.  I did try cooking with it by adding some to butter when cooking eggs.  I didn't taste any coconut, so I was happy with that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good product because it didn't have a strong taste and I will be purchasing it again."
967,B003B3OOPA,5,Seems like a fine product to me!,"I made use of Amazon Prime when I bought this, and it arrived right on time. Although after only about a week it's early to make any judgments about what affects it might have had on my health, I really enjoyed using this coconut oil. I've found that my favorite use for it is on toast with peanut butter! I've also been putting it on my hands in the evening, and I can actually tell a difference in how they look. I didn't ever expect to be able to say that!"
968,B003B3OOPA,5,As Expected,I have not yet used this product.  I have ordered the Nutiva brand in the past and like the product.  This brand was cheaper this time.  I cook with the coconut oil frequently and wanted to have a spare on hand.  This is my spare.  Overall I received the product as expected and on time.  I will order again in the future.
969,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent,I'm so pleased with the quality and value of this coconut oil so we subscribed to auto delivery. We use it for all our cooking and and baking...we especially love popping popcorn in it.  The health benefits of coconut oil make it a staple in our home  My daughters and I make a sugar scrub using this oil as the base as well.  Last summer we used it as a chemical free sunscreen (SPF 4) and hair conditioner.  We love discovering more and more uses for it!
970,B003B3OOPA,5,Fave Coconut Oil,This is my favorite Coconut Oil for the price.  Nice texture and taste.<br /><br />I don't know what I did before Coconut Oil.  So good and good for ya.<br /><br />In the morning I wake up and make 2 scrambled eggs using Coconut Oil.  Delish!  And my body loves it.
971,B003B3OOPA,5,I feel better and look better,"I bought the pint size at first just to try it. Now I am buying the 48 ounce (3 pack). I can not see ever ever ever running out of this stuff. I swear I think my belly fat is melting away. I know I feel better and that is no small thing. The book that got me started was The Coconut Diet, by Cherie Calbom (The Juice Lady) and her husband. Then the benefits of coconut oil are reinforced in Wheat Belly, by William Davis, M.D. I am Southern, so I tried breading okra in almond flour and frying it in coconut oil. Now I am trying to learn to cook with coconut flour too. I am off wheat and dairy completely and don't feel deprived. Can't beat that."
972,B003B3OOPA,5,"AA, relaxed hair, 1/2a","I am in love. Mind you, I only used this oil once and I cannot wait until I deep condition with this overnight. All I did was moisturize my hair before I did my bantu knot outs, and my hair was instantly moisturized. I used my mango butter (Elasta qp) to apply the lotion part, but trust, I didn;t need it. COCONUT OIL IS THE WAY TO GO, esp if you are on a hair journey :-)"
973,B003B3OOPA,4,Great Quality; not a good item shipped?,"I really enjoy using this product in cooking (popcorn, pancakes, etc) but both shipments I have received have leaked a little. It was strange because the product seemed sealed (I did not find any evidence that it had been opened), but there were clear oil drippings that seeped through the packaging. It was definately coconut oil, as I could tell from the scent. I will no longer get this item shipped. Instead I will buy some at a store."
974,B003B3OOPA,5,Simply great.,"Fast delivery, and the product is just simply ""great"". So multipurposeful and easy to use. It's great on skin, great in hair, and great to cook with. It's just, ""Simply Great""!"
975,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing stuff!  Cook and bake with this!,"This of course smells wonderfully like coconut, and is smooth and easy to work with.  I've used it in brownie batter recently in place of vegetable oil, and they were wonderful and with a slight aroma and taste of coconut...ymumm!<br /><br />Warning, it cooks eggs fine too, but the slight coconut edge to the scrambled eggs takes a little getting used to."
976,B003B3OOPA,3,Coconut oil for knee pain/arthritis,"As recommended by my nutritionist friend started using this to help with my knee pain.  Although I guess that this might have helped me I am not certain as I also do other exercises which have most definitely benefited me.  The product comes neatly packed and has a nice aroma.  I have been using this for about two months now and although I have heard good things about coconut oil, I have to discuss this with my doctor during my next visit and get lab work done to determine if the use has affected my cholesterol levels."
977,B003B3OOPA,5,love,"It is healthy for my heart, makes my food taste great, my skin glow---what else do I want? I bought it here yet I later found it at a vitamin shop for the same price. Recommend it! If possible also purchase The Coconut Oil Miracle book. It has recipes & great info"
978,B003B3OOPA,5,Super quality - will never order any other brand,I purchased this because I'm on Weight Watchers and had read about how helpful EV Coconut Oil can be on a weight loss program.  It has definitely helped me shed the weight - especially around my belly.  I also love using it on my skin and hair - it makes them feel so healthy.<br /><br />I found that if you keep it at temps above 76 degrees it stays pretty clear - but if you live in a cooler climate (or have air conditioning) it can solidify.  I find that I can only consume it when it's in a liquid state - I seem to gag if it's even slightly solid.  Just a few seconds in the microwave can fix that.  I highly recommend this brand - it tastes great and works!
979,B003B3OOPA,5,Raw,Using this product as a natural moisturizer for my hair was one of the best decision that I have ever made. It does not leave a greasy feeling. It smells great and leaves a shine for healthy hair.
980,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful,"This product smells absolutely wonderful, like a coconut pie after toasting the coconut in the oven. It's smooth to the taste, although coconut oil doesn't have a taste.  It shipped really quick. I will buy this product again."
981,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent Product,I really love this product.  It is a great buy for the price and quality.  This is the 3rd time I have purchased this product and I am very happy with the timely delivery and quality. I would recommend this and I love organic.
982,B003B3OOPA,5,Pain free,I have been using coconut oil for over a year now.  It's used in cooking and after a few weeks I noticed that the arthritis pain in my hands is does not exist unless I don't use for a week.  It is a side benefit of coconut oil.
983,B003B3OOPA,3,coconut oil review,"Item is satisfactory .... I think it may be of some benefit.<br /><br />i seem to be having more energy, but I take it along with MCT oil<br /><br />so it is difficult to see which is working. But combining the two<br />seems to help."
984,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this product,I just love this product.  I actually use it on my hair and skin.  My husband has skin blemish due to the sun on his back and I have been using it for 2 weeks for him every night and they are almost gone.
985,B003B3OOPA,5,The best!,"This is the best for a lot of thing even for a nice and sensual massage and to end up the massage in a intimate way..... Excellent for all body, nice smell...."
986,B003B3OOPA,5,Does exactly what they say it does,Good for your skin when you use it in moderation and diluted with another masking product so you don't smell like a coconut cream pie. Most excellent as a dietary supplement to keep you regular. Awesome to cook and fry with when you can use that extra coconut spice. I buy two or separate one for the bathroom and kitchen.
987,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful,"I use it everyday, my skin, my hair, my food. Awesome Definetely I would recommend to a friend and I would buy more."
988,B003B3OOPA,5,The Best,OMG I can not get over how great this Coconut Oil is! I use it to moisturize my hair & my hair loves it. My hair is in good health because of this product. I will always keep this has a staple. Love Love Love it :)
989,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells sooo good!!!!!,"Don't know why I didn't get this a long time ago.......it's the best skin care product; one without any chemicals(parabens/sulfates)<br />I make sure my shampoos are the same.  Chemicals are in  EVERYTHING!  This stuff tastes good, too.  And I just love the coconut smell!!!<br />I can eat almost anything w/coconut in it and when I use this at nite, I go to bed smelling it on my hands, like I've got a coconut cookie, pie, or ice cream at my side :)  Great product!!"
990,B003B3OOPA,5,I hope the mayonnaise people don't find out 8^),"about this great product. It may put them out of business! LOL.<br /><br />For years, I'd been using mayonnaise for all my cooking and facial moisturizing needs. No longer.<br /><br />This coconut oil leaves a much nicer residue and doesn't attract as many bees.<br /><br />Thank you, EfaGold!"
991,B003B3OOPA,5,"Affordable, versatile","Much more affordable that in my local grocery store. I use this stuff as a moisturizer, in my cooking, as a base for cleaning products and even give some to my dog to keep her coat shiny. The coconut smell is actually quite mild, which I like, I don't like it to be overwhelming other smells/flavors. I bought another brand previously but it was hard to get all the coconut oil out, the shape of this brand's container makes it easy to access the full container. Just polished off the last jar after many months. Will keep buying this brand from Amazon."
992,B003B3OOPA,5,Works great and is affortable!,I started using coconut oil on my hair when I went natural.  This works great on my hair and it is very affortable!  I may use it for other uses people have described.
993,B003B3OOPA,4,So many uses...,I really like this coconut oil.  It's great for cooking.  It's also great for skin and (if necessary) haircare. There are so many uses for coconut oil that it is a staple item in my home!
994,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome coconut oil,Great product. We have one in the kitchen for cooking and one on the baby's changing table for diaper rashes!
995,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful product,I love this coconut oil.  I use it for everything.  I have a jar in the kitchen and the bath.  I love that i can use it on my skin and also in my biscuits.  Great stuff.
996,B003B3OOPA,4,Great Product!,"I use this all the time for cooking, and as a hair and body moisturizer.  My only complaint is that my kitchen stays quite warm so the coconut oil is always liquid.  When you pour from the jar, it dribbles down the side so it always leaves a telltale ring on the counter.  If that could be resolved, this would be a five star product for me."
997,B003B3OOPA,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!,"I use this stuff for EVERYTHING!! From cooking, to pre-pooing my hair and moisturizing my baby's skin. It's the best thing since sliced bread!!"
998,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,Nature's way organic extra virgin coconut oil is a great product for the skin and hair. You will love the way it makes your skin feel smooth and soft. this coconut oil makes the hair feel healthy and it smells good.

1000,B003B3OOPA,5,Sold,I am love the smell of this coconut oil.  I've used it as a leave in hair conditioner and as a lotion.  It absorbs super quick and does not leave a greasy residue! There are a ton of other uses for this product and I'm looking forward to trying them all!  I will def purchase this again!
1001,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for hair!,I use it in my hair and it hydrates without leaving it greasy. Smells great!<br />I have very thick curly hair and it makes it more manageable.
1002,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product,"I purchased this product & it tastes great, I use it as a herbal supplement, & I will definitely buy it again."
1003,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,"I really like the coconut oil.  However, I do not consume enough to get one every month.  I use it as a hair and body moisturizer, and use it for oil in cooking.  Thanks, I truly enjoy it."
1004,B003B3OOPA,5,Nature's Way Coconut oil,"Many of you may have recieved a e mail regarding a Mary Newport husband Steve that has Alzheimer's: ""She has written an article, What If There Was a Cure for Alzheimer's Disease and No One Knew?"" relaying her family's experience with this disease and her research into a dietary intervention that may benefit persons with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Well I recieved the email and we have Alzheimer's in our family.  Price for Coconut oil vary a lot.  The price on Amazon is the best that I found.  The product come on a monthly basics and we have switched to only Coconut oil for cooking.  Bruce Fifi  writes about Coconut oil and the advantages of using it.  Which you can also order on Amazon.  It is good reading if you are interested in your health and would like to loose weight.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-EfaGold-Organic-32-Ounce/dp/B003OGKCDC/ref=sr_1_5?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1346955176&sr=1-5<br />The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil) [Paperback]"
1005,B003B3OOPA,5,LOVE coconut oil!,"This has become a ""can't live without"" product in my kitchen. It's my main cooking fat since it's more heat stable than olive oil and it makes the best pork chops we've ever eaten. I also use it for baking and for making roasted veggies. Even our dogs get a little scoop of coconut oil with their dinner each night and their fur is immaculate--even the rescue pup who has a fungal skin infection that we've struggled to manage."
1006,B003B3OOPA,4,Love it!!,I got this product sooner than expected... I tried Coconut Oil before but I wanted to try a different more organic version and this is wonderful. It is lighter than the one I previously used. All in all.... I love this product!!
1007,B003B3OOPA,5,conditions hair,I think it helps to conditions  hair. It also works great on skin. need more time with it to see if it does a good deep condition on hair. smell is good but too much makes me run lol
1008,B003B3OOPA,5,My favorite coconut oil,I have tried several brands of extra virgin coconut oil and like this one the best.  YOu get what you pay for.
1009,B003B3OOPA,2,not very tasty compared to other brands,"I was not pleased with this brand. Usually I buy Nutiva and tried this because it was less expensive. However, the taste is quite different. This tastes watery and almost plastic compared to Nutiva. I would like to send this back."
1010,B003B3OOPA,4,Favorite Coconut Product,I tried this Organic Extra virgin coconut oil since I already read good things about it and it worked wonders on my hair and skin.
1011,B003B3OOPA,5,Workout Plus,"People have recently been asking how I've lost 7lbs in 1 1/2 weeks. No i don't eat salads everyday, I eat healthy or try to most of the week, but I'm not strict on what I eat everyday. 1 thing however hasn't changed. The use of this product boasts amazing results. My metabolism has never been higher and I've been in the greatest shape of my life. I add this stuff to my protein shakes and most of my meals!"
1012,B003B3OOPA,4,Coconut Oil,I really liked the coconut oil I use it on  my skin and my hair--my one complaint was one of the jars was leaking and it leaked all over the other jars--other than that I am a very happy camper.
1013,B003B3OOPA,5,Great to fry with,"This coconut oil is great for frying at a higher temp. I use Nutiva for everyday cooking like eggs, or baking."
1014,B003B3OOPA,5,Really Nice!,I use this for my skin directly and making body butter and lotion stick.  It's top quality.  It's great for cooking and eating!
1015,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,Very happy with the product. Last shipment got too warm in transit though and I ended up with a box of leaked oil. That was a little upsetting.
1016,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product,"We use this product in popcorn, as cooking oil, and it gives a great taste to every thing we cook and use it with."
1017,B003B3OOPA,4,Very acceptable,"I have no complaints, although I didn't give it 5 stars because the kind I<br />used to buy had little bits of coconut in the oil...in other words it seems like it<br />has been somewhat refined."
1018,B003B3OOPA,5,amazing amazing amazing!,"I use this in my hair, on my dried skin and to cook. i smell like coconut all the time... people keep asking me what fragrance i use and my reply is always coconut oil. LOL!"
1019,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,"The product was shipped very quickly.  I love the coconut oil.  I use it for a moisturizer, hair conditioner, and in baking."
1020,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this!,Coconut oil has many uses and this size jar was sold at amazon at a great price...especially being that it's organic.  It's not heavy but it does absorb quickly without leaving a greasy feeling.  So far I've used it on mine and my daughter's hair...it works great.
1021,B003B3OOPA,5,Prepoo for Hair,"I use this as a hot oil treatment before I shampoo my hair. It's awesome, it's make my hair soft, strong and shiny. I place 1 tsp in a  bowl then place the bowl in hot water to heat it up, then I apply it to my hair. Afterwards I cover with a plastic cap and satin scarf/bonnet for 1-3 hrs, rinse then shampoo. I also add it to my deep conditioners. And use it to seal in my moisturizers daily"
1022,B003B3OOPA,5,Gold in a cup.,My natural coils absolutely love this coconut oil. I rub about half a teaspoon in after I do my co-washes. I haven't yet gained the courage to add a bit to my smoothies because the thought of it is kind of weird but it is ORGANIC so I just might. Love it when it's soft- not so much when oil/room temp or rock hard/cold.
1023,B003B3OOPA,5,I really like this coconut oil!!!,This is my second time ordering this product and I really like it.  This is a great buy from the seller and I would definitely recommend this product!!
1024,B003B3OOPA,5,Miracle stuff,I love love love this coconut oil. I use it for cooking and for skin care for my baby. It is safe on skin. And I dont care if she tries to lick it off.  Great as diaper cream with cloth diaper too.
1025,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent,This coconut oil has a nice smooth texture at a reasonable price. We use it for homemade oil mixtures and for message.
1026,B003B3OOPA,4,Great for use on hair!,This coconut oil is an excellent oil for sealing moisture into the hair shaft. I have been using it lightly twice a day since I received my order and it works wonders! I love this stuff!
1027,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,This is a great product. I was surprised at the many uses I found for it! My favorite was on toast. Very nice mild flavor.
1028,B003B3OOPA,4,Great all around product,"I bought this at my local health food store, not Amazon. It was on sale for a little cheaper. So far I tried this mostly on my skin and it is wonderful. It's slick, not greasy or heavy at all. I used it to soften my cuticles and I've never seen my nails look so radiant. Still haven't used it for my hair yet but I'll get to that sometime in the future.<br /><br />As for taking it as a supplement. The taste isn't bad. I do love the taste of coconut and for some reason I expected it to be slightly sweet but its not. It was hard to swallow a spoonful because the texture felt like I was eating lard. However, when spread on toast it is rather delicious. It's still to early to notice any difference on my health. Would buy again as a lotion though."
1029,B003B3OOPA,5,I love it!,"I love this coconut oil. I use it for my hair, skin and cooking! The hair is so soft after this. Use it as a nod cream.The best!"
1030,B003B3OOPA,3,I wish this worked for my Eczema :(,"To be fair, I'm not the ""Patch of Eczema here, patch of Eczema there"" kind of person.  I'm head to toe, since birth - so I'm fairly used to things not working very well :)  However, I was really hopeful for this after seeing the reviews.  It smells like a handful of fresh coconut, which I thought was nice!  I liked the smell.  It's very mild.  You do have to scrape it ouf of the container and let it melt in your hands before applying.  You get used to it.  It doesn't absorb as well as other oils.  Kinds of sits on the surface, so before bed is best.  I still use it occasionally mixed with other creams and lotions.  On it's own, it wasn't enough for my skin.  No miracle cure here.  But its still a nice smelling body oil.<br /><br />I did not eat it.  I have stomach issues that make that easier said than done :)"
1031,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Stuff,"Didn't know whether to expect high quality, safely sealed, and usable product or not, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The product was fully packed, has a great seal at the top, and smells amazing.<br /><br />I've seperated part of the product for cosmetic uses into small containers and have the rest in my pantry to cook with (which I look forward to).<br /><br />I've started using this under my eyes at night before bed and the moisturing properties are fantastic."
1032,B003B3OOPA,4,Good value on a healthy oil,We've used this product several times now for varying uses.  The product feels great on the skin and is an ideal personal lubricant.  We have also cooked with the product.  Highly recommended for it's value.
1033,B003B3OOPA,5,Perfect Coconut Oil,"Second time buying the coconut oil and I'm yet to be disappointed. It stays at room temperature, and I use it for my moisturizing sprtitz, deep conditioners, and lotions."
1034,B003B3OOPA,4,Nature's Way Extra Virgin Coconut Oil- Amazon,"Fantasic product! Fast shipping! A little but goes a long way! I will buy again.  However, next time, I will get a bigger jar."
1035,B003B3OOPA,5,I love coconuts.,"This is a must have if you're a college student cooking for yourself. I can use this on the pan, I can use this on a banana sandwich (which is delicious with speculoos and lightly toasted bread), and sometimes I just stick it into whatever is in the pot just for fun. Coconut oil is good for your health. It smells great too."
1036,B003B3OOPA,5,let me count the ways I can use the coconut oil,I use this on my hair to moisturize it and for conditioner. It is good to use on the skin as a moisturizer and for different problems.  It is also good for cooking and eating. I will spread some on a piece of wheat bread when I am hungry and need a quick snack.  In my opinion it is also good for the digestive system.
1037,B003B3OOPA,5,Love me some coconut oil,"I like cooking with this stuff.  You can taste it in your food sometimes, and I actually like my foods better with it, on top of that i have lost a lil weight using coconut oil (even better ;))"
1038,B003B3OOPA,5,Use on my little ones diaper rash!,This works amazing on my sons diaper rash! All of the regular diaper rash cream didn't help at all but this stuff cleared it up in ONE day!
1039,B003B3OOPA,5,Organic coconut oil what more to say,"This is good quality coconut oil, i use it mostly for my hair as a hot oil treatment and it is wonderful. The jar is plastic which would be better if it was glass, but not a huge problem that you can't deal with. You can use this for cooking as well and it has a nice strong coconut smell. Just good product overall, really doesn't have much to say."
1040,B003B3OOPA,5,Best one out there,"Believe in all the reviews, this product is A+! Best coconut of all coconut oils I have tried (I am a coconut oil fanatic), the strong is a little stronger. I think this one is more healthy as well, with a great price and amazing quality. I put it in everything and know that it is good for me!"
1041,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells Heavenly,"I love this Coconut oil, it smell delicious. I do not use it for cooking but for my hair, it leaves my hair smooth, manageable and shinny."
1042,B003B3OOPA,4,Coconut Oil,All  you need is just a little bit coconut oil for cooking or baking and it is very health for you.  You can smell the coconut during cooking and that is great for coconut and curry chicken dish.
1043,B003B3OOPA,5,frhgthyrfedws yeyeyey,"I really like this oil. Its amazing. I use it for my hair, and skin, and omfg. The first treatment I did to my hair, made it silky soft, shiny, and, it was not frizzy. Thank teh lard. And I used it on my gigantic pimple, the first 10 minutes, the redness from my pimple went away, and overnight, my pimple shrunk a decent amount. I havent consumed this yet. Not planning to. Just a (natural) beauty product for me."
1044,B003B3OOPA,5,great conditioner,"I am hawaiian and we appreciate the light -airy heritage extremely long hair that is our signature.  This product is a wonder worker to keep my hair soft, the cuticles are stronger, and I like the fragrance, too."
1045,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product,"I received the coconut oil very promptly. It has great flavor, I am enjoying cooking with it and I am teaching my son the many uses it has."
1046,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for Hair!,"This coconut oil is great! I bought it for my hair but before I started using it I tasted it and I will surely consider using it for cooking too. Anyway, I have natural hair and it's really great at locking the moisture in. I'm about to reorder because I've used it all. I also used it on my skin and that worked out fabulous as well. If you have a jar of this, you can get a lot of use out of it."
1047,B003B3OOPA,4,Very good product and taste,"This is a very good product,it seems healthy to eat everyday, although I cannot see the results yet. I plan in buying more."
1048,B003B3OOPA,5,AMAZING,"the jar leaked a bit in transport and was misshappen because it had been laying on its side, but the quality of this product is amazing. it smells sooooo good and just melts in your hand. as soon as it hits your skin/scalp/hair it instantly soothes. So happy I started using coconut oil, and its so cheap too!"
1049,B003B3OOPA,5,I love it,"I can't use this on my skin because it breaks me out and gives me pimples, but it's fine for my hair and I love the smell. The only negative about this is that it goes back to its hardened state in the cold and dries my hair, scalp and lips out which is why I'll probably switch to Jamaican black castor oil after I finish this up. Other than that I love this stuff. It makes my hands soft and my nails really nice, too."
1050,B003B3OOPA,5,Very helpful,"I suffer from frequent yeast infections. This product was recommended to me to be applied as a cream for treatment. It cuts down itching, burning feeling you get with a yeast infection, makes it a lot more tolerable. Not a quick cure, but if used at the onset of the symptoms can help keep it to a minimum."
1051,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious and Nutritious!,"Just received this item and purchasing Coconut Oil for the first time. Nice pound jar (16 oz.)and upon opening it noticed that the texture and white appearance does look like Crisco oil from the can. However, the wonderful coconut scent takes me back to my Bounty candy bar eating days, and eating the recommended one tablespoon a day has turned out to be a treat because it tastes like coconut too!"
1052,B003B3OOPA,5,"Excellent product for cooking, hair and body",My family loves this product. I cook with and it taste great. I use it on my body and also on my haisr. It is a great product.
1053,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I was happy to hear about coconut oil, and have found it to be easy to use, and the faint taste of coconut is very pleasant."
1054,B003B3OOPA,5,New Concept,"Nature's Way EfaGold Coconut Oil -- 16 fl oz  Only recently heard that Coconut Oil offered a number of health benefits, particularly in helping to maintain and improve memory.  I recently got my first order from you and surprised it's so easy to use and has many additional benefits I hadn't expected.  I'm now reading up on best ways to benefit and expected timelines.  What really surprised me is how abundant Coconut Oil is, and affordability.  Interested to see where it takes me a few months down the road."
1055,B003B3OOPA,5,Organic Coconut oil,"I have used two containers so far and am almost ready to redorder. I no longer use butter, I use it on bread, in oatmeal, and stirfrys. Also skin care is very good. Amazon had the best price."
1056,B003B3OOPA,5,Exactly what I needed,"Great quality, decent price. I use it for my hair, face, skin, and for cooking. I also use it on my kids in place of lotion and conditioner. Works great on diaper rash as well."
1057,B003B3OOPA,5,Very good natural moisturizer,"I really like this product,rich misturizer for skin and I know it,s natural.I also mix it with shea butter and cocoa butter for rich,luxurious expirience."
1058,B003B3OOPA,5,One word to describe - LOVE!,"I used this both for cooking and for hair and I am madly in love with it.  It's perfect in every way. BUY IT, NOW!"
1059,B003B3OOPA,4,A bit of yellow color,"Not sure if this is good, bad or indifferent, but I got a can of this and in the small amount of liquid phase at the bottom of the jar, it was slightly yellow colored.  Havent had any of this yet, doubt it is rancid or anything, but it is a bit off-color."
1060,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I started using this about a month ago after reading a lot of the benefits of coconut oil.  I have used it on my hair for great results, and I add it to my oatmeal or on my toast, or just take it straight.  I will see if I see any difference in my cholesterol levels when I go to the doctor.  Coconut oil is good to add to your diet for so many reasons that I will probably include this in my diet forever."
1061,B003B3OOPA,5,Satisfied,The product came on time as stated. It was packaged very well. The taste is not too strong and I have also used it for cooking. I thought the price was fair. I would buy from this seller again. I like dealing with Amazon.
1062,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for dry skin/eczema!,"I don't generally review products, but this works so well for me that I wanted to write about it in hopes someone with the same problem will read this and give coconut oil a try.<br /><br />For years I've been trying to find some sort of moisturizing lotion, ointment, or oil that would relieve my extremely dry skin. Lotions required constant reapplication, so they were expensive and inconvenient. Ointments were too thick and would make my skin hot and sometimes exacerbate itching. Baby oil didn't seem thick enough. The best solution I found was dissolving a bit of ointment in sesame oil with a dab of steroid ointment to control itching. It was okay, but not great. Plus, I quickly tired of smelling like popcorn.<br /><br />My dermatologist recommended that I try coconut oil. I've been astonished by how well it works. After only two days of use, my eczema rashes had faded considerably because they longer itched. Patches that I had for months were suddenly gone. The rest of my skin no longer feels dry and tight, which means no new rashes! I only have to apply coconut oil in the morning and after my shower with no need to reapply throughout the day. Best of all, I smell (quite literally) like a fresh coconut right after I apply it, and the scent fades rather quickly (so I don't get sick of it).<br /><br />I realize this sounds too good to be true, and I'll be sure to update if the product suddenly stops working. But for the time being, I'm absolutely thrilled with the improvement I've seen in my skin!"
1063,B003B3OOPA,5,AMAZING CURE ALL!!!,"Ok i have been using this brand of coconut oil for about 3 months now. I have been eating it, and i have hypothyroidism. It has made me feel so much better, more energy, swelling in my throat has gone down and it tastes great! i make chocolate shakes with it. I also use it as a skin lotion, no more dry skin and it smells soo good. I use it on my hair, no more dry hair, it has helped me grow my hair out and its really shiny. I have also been using it on my face, it has completely gotten rid of my acne and is quickly fading my acne scars, and no it does not clog my pores. This coconut oil is amazing, i love it!!!"
1064,B003B3OOPA,5,Can't Ever Be Without,"I don't want to ever be without this coconut oil. I have been using it for quite some time now, and am 69 yrs of age.  I went to see my doctor for my six mths check up,  and she was amazed at my colostrol levels.  She said they were perfect, and wondered what my secret was.  I didn't tell her my secret,  but I do stay away from fatty foods,  and use this cooking oil for frying,  and also baking,  and it gives my food a wonderful flavor.  Tasting this oil alone,  has a delicious coconut taste,  but that same taste doesn't show up in the foods that I use it in, and I don't think one can beat this price anywhere.  I was paying twice as much as this from another company,  plus shipping and handling, but this is a super deal,  no postage,  and half the price.  I just hope Natures Way will never stop having this coconut oil available, I also like the fact that it is organic.  I will continue ordering this oil as long as it is available."
1065,B003B3OOPA,4,Multi-Use Product for Great Price,"So I started using this the day I received it in the mail (fast shipping btw) and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I use this 1-2 times a day when I have a smoothie, sometimes as a little spread on my toast, and for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin (on my face and back) so I tend to use it everywhere else on my body.<br /><br />In regards to the supplement, it does in fact suppress your appetite, which will than lead to smaller portion control if you were ever to stop using this as a supplement.<br /><br />My next step would be to use it for a replacement of cooking oil but hopefully the meat won't have that taste of coconut...I love coconut but not to that extent."
1066,B003B3OOPA,5,Love This Product,"This Coconut Oil is super good, so good I have it on auto order. It is organic, tastes great, smells great, very fresh, ships fast..I love it. I use it in place of butter or margarine on my food, I use it to stir fry, I also use it on my face. I am a vegetarian and would recommend it to others. One of my favorite dishes is baked sweet potato, I cut a large one in half after baking and put Natures Way coconut oil, cinnamon, and pecan pieces on top. Everyone that eats one of these says ""I taste fresh coconut on this, how did you do that?"". I don't mean to rant but this product is something to rant about! Just try it, you will like it."
1067,B003B3OOPA,5,Different from Nutiva,"I have always used Nutiva brand coconut oil and ordered this brand to try because it was on sale. From now on I will probably keep both brands in the house as I found them to be pretty different from one another and useful for different purposes. The Nutiva brand definitely has a lot more coconut flavor, adding a lot more flavor to smoothies or in cooking. This brand absorbs into the skin a lot faster, without leaving the oily film on top of the skin, so I will continue to use this coconut oil for skin and hair care."
1068,B003B3OOPA,5,This stuff is great!!,"I have done so much research on coconut oil, because I've heard only good things about it. So I finally got it.My skin has never felt better and looked better, and it has only done wonderful things to my hair.Forget about all the expensive creams(they're all a scam) because coconut oil is all you need for you hair and skin issues.I would definitely buy this again, and recommend it to everyone.Thank you Nature's way coconut oil!"
1069,B003B3OOPA,4,Not great for cooking....,"I use coconut oil for as much as I can...  Skincare, hair, cooking, etc.  I will say that this product is better for skincare and hair.  My husband has loved the change now that I'm cooking with coconut oil but when I used this one on his morning eggs he new immediately that it was a new one.  He said ""I can really taste the coconut in my eggs"".  So I switched back to my other organic coconut oil for cooking."
1070,B003B3OOPA,5,i love this coconut oil,"i love this coconut oil i use it on my hair lips and skin, it smells so good and it really moisturizes im definitely buying again well once i get off my buying freeze cuz i need to replenish i would recommend this to anyone looking for coconut oil for thier hair as a moisturizer.<br />i know nothing bout using it as food never tried i might my next batch i order"
1071,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product for sealing moisture in your hair!,"I love this product! I usually mix it with shea butter and olive oil and apply it to my hair over my conditioner to seal in the moisure. I works great because I have been retaining hair length and I rarely experience any breakage. The smell is okay and its texture is good. I also use this same mixture as a skin moisturizer and also to wash my face using a oil cleansing method. I haven't had any new breakout since I starting using it. Overall, its a good buy!"
1072,B003B3OOPA,5,Very pleased with the Organic coconut oil,We are very pleased with this coconut oil! This is a great product that should be in every home. It works well on the skin and in the kitchen.
1073,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I chose this coconut oil because of the many positive reviews it received. I love everything about this product! I am a college student, and the water that I use here at school (to shower) is very drying to my skin. This coconut oil combats the drying effects of the water and leaves my skin feeling so soft. It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly. It also smells wonderful! Everyone in my family LOVES it. I would highly recommend it to others."
1074,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product...,"I only have one word for this Coconut oil ""AMAZING"" ! I use it in my hair, on my skin and even to cook. I will definitely purchase more!"
1075,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product...,Coconut Oil + sugar + milk: I put it on a mug for 2 min. on a microwave and ... delicious... I've been taking twice daily for a week. It might have helped me fighting with my scale. I'll be buying a second one today.
1076,B003B3OOPA,5,Coco for Coconut Oil,We use this for cooking. A friend told me to use on my face as a night moisturizer & what a difference my skin now has in my morning after I wake. Here's to coconut keeping me youthful in more ways than one!
1077,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for hair!!!!!!!!!,I bought this product for a leave-in conditioner and it works great! Hair feels and looks so silky soft after I wash it out. Couldn't be happier! It smells great too. I hope Amazon never stops selling this product.
1078,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product!,The product tastes very good! I will update my review once I have used it for at least a month.<br /><br />06/19/12 Update: I've been using this product as a body lotion and hair moisturizer and I don't have any complaints. The coconut oil has made my skin so silky soft and my hair has stopped falling out so much. The smell is not too strong of coconut and easily absorbed when applied to the skin.
1079,B003B3OOPA,5,LOOOOVE,"I bought this to use as a moisturizer and I'm glad I did. Smells amazing and feels great! Great for the cold, dry summer!"
1080,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent Moisturizer!,"I use this for moisturizing my skin and to heal my toddler's chapped lips.  It works well, smells yummy, and I'm not scared that my daughter will get sick if she licks it off."
1081,B003B3OOPA,5,Great!,"This product is great! I love the smell and the fact that coconut oil is multipurpose. I mainly use it in my daughters hair as a moisturizer, and for dry skin. It makes my skin feel so soft."
1082,B003B3OOPA,5,This stuff is amazing,"This is really great stuff<br />great for the winter when your skin is dry, hydrates right away. really good for you!<br />truly a quality product! well recommended, will buy more when i run out."
1083,B003B3OOPA,5,EXCELLENT,"This oil is great for your hair, skin, and food!! I love it. ALL NATURAL. You can melt it and it turns into a miracle oil.. Glad I found it!"
1084,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it,I use this organic coconut oil in my sons hair. Its fantastic. Smells great. Doesn't leave his hair dry. No sulfate. Best of all it can be use for other things to. Like cooking or to lotion your skin. Would buy again and again.
1085,B003B3OOPA,5,Very good product.,"a very good value for money product.<br />It is nice, does not smell.<br />And because it comes in a jar, we can just scoop the coconut oil out of it."
1086,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious,"Great stuff. Can use as cooiking oil or as a spread like you would butter. Extra virgin tastes like coconut, so keep that in mind as you use it in cooiking."
1087,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!,"Versatile coconut oil, I love it a lot. I mainly use it for my hair which leaves it manageable, moisturized and soft. Because of all the good properties a coconut has, this oil is great for people that are suffering from acne. By taking it as a supplement, cooking with it and/or just using it as a moisturizer(face and body) will definitely help. I highly recommend this product!"
1088,B003B3OOPA,5,Lovely product.,"I use this product as a moisturizer.  It has a fabulous smell, and it is great quality coconut oil.  I had to order this since it's getting cold, because the oil becomes a solid.  Since this is in a jar, you can still scoop it out.  It is also a great moisturizer for curly hair."
1089,B003B3OOPA,4,Smell so good,"I really like this oil, you can also use it to cook. I prefer to use it as body moisturizer. Apply lightly because it is really oily."
1090,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for cooking,"I ordered this coconut oil a few weeks ago, since then I've used it in cooking to replace less healthy oils and in baking as a substitute for butter or margarine.  It easy to work with and it tastes fantastic.  I've used it in everything from stir fry to brownies, it's delicious and healthy.  Who could ask for more?"
1091,B003B3OOPA,5,Great!,"Smells so delicious! This is some of the best coconut oil I've ever had. IT is hydrating for the skin and great to ingest! It does melt under heat, so be sure to refrigerate. Love it."
1092,B003B3OOPA,5,Black Relaxed Hair,I love this coconut oil. I use this on my hair. I love the fact that its solid but melts in your hair. Its so light and smells wonderful. This is my number one oil I use to seal in moisture.
1093,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut oil,"I love the product , it is an awesome product, and you get a lot for your money<br />the container was way bigger than i expected. Highly recommend."
1094,B003B3OOPA,5,tasty coconut oil,this organic coconut oil is very white and delicious...it is not pale like some coconut oil i have purchased in the past...they looked oily sort of ..this is a very good grade of coconut oil.i use it in my manna balls recipe...it is good for rubbing into your hands to soften them and lubricate them it smells wonderful...and taste delicious...it is liquid at room temperture and solid at room temperture according to the temp of your room it is in...a good buy  16 oz jar bought on amazon.com
1095,B003B3OOPA,5,Good price for good product,"I use it as spread instead of butter.  It's delicious. My whole family like it including my young daughters. What's more the price is great, less than $7 including shipping. A great buy!"
1096,B003B3OOPA,5,Great all natural moisturizer,"I have been using this as a moisturizer (less than a teaspoonful) for my entire body and it hasn't caused any breakouts, even on my face. For this price, it is very economical and a purer moisturizer compared to many lotions. It melts in your hand and a little bit goes a long way.  It has a very slight coconut scent which reminds me of the beach and suntan lotion. It doesn't have a greasy feel and it doesn't transfer to clothes as long as you use just a little bit - you won't need much."
1097,B003B3OOPA,5,Smooth and Tasty,"I have been using this coconut oil for the past few days and I am happy with the results.  I first tried it on its own and the consistency was not too appealing to me, so I began putting it in my meals and that works better for me.  I have also used a portion of it with some Shea Butter as a moisturizer and it works great as well.  It seems to me the uses are endless.  I can see that I will be purchasing another container of this because it is so versatile and all natural.  I really love that and I love this coconut oil.  It does have a slight coconut taste and smell.  I get a hint of it when i cook with it but it is does not over power any of the dishes that I make with it.  Also it absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it soft but not greasy and there is slight coconut smell but it fades quickly once absorb into the skin.  It is a bit pricey and is definitely an investment.  The serving size of 1 tablespoon 3-4 times a day is a bit much and will contribute to the necessity of purchasing another jar quicker than I would like.  Overall, very happy with my purchase.  As always thanks Amazon for such a wide and wonderful selection of products."
1098,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"I use this oil all the time for cooking. It adds a great flavor, especially to fish and chicken. Great for sauteing!"
1099,B003B3OOPA,5,LOVE IT,"After reading the great reviews, I ordered this product for my natural hair.  All I can say is I LOVE IT!  I massage the oil on my scalp every night, it makes my hair nice and soft.  I use it in my daughters hair who's also natural, it make it easier to staighen her hair and it leaves a beautiful shine. Her teachers and classmates always giving her compliments and inquiring about this product. I also mix it with shea butter works wonders on the skin especially during the winter season.  My family love this product I will be ordering more.  Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery.  Very happy with this product."
1100,B003B3OOPA,5,I simply love it!,"First of all I really like the consistency of this oil, then comes the taste! It's great for cooking, adding into oatmeal, over salads and the list goes on and on. I am very happy with this product and will definitely continue to purchase this particular brand. Also, the price point is definitely right. Similar products in the health food stores sell for over $10.00. In short, it's organic, tastes great, excellent for cooking and your health so purchase with confidence!"
1101,B003B3OOPA,5,good product,"i have been using it on my hair as lotion, to eat just in tablespoons i have seen a small improvement on my skin."
1102,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious,"This coconut oil is great.  I haven't tried many others, but this one is organic and everything at a great price so I went for it and I'm loving it."
1103,B003B3OOPA,5,Yay for coconut oil!,"I use this for the bumps on my upper arms.  It helps keep the skin moisturized after exfoliating, apply post-shower.  It works!  And smells great.  It surprisingly soaks in quite quickly as well.  I have not eaten this product.  :)"
1104,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product,It worked well as a hair conditioner and it was packaged well. I also used it as a skin moisturizer. Has a light coconut smell. I plan to start cooking with it soon.
1105,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product!,"I use this as my hair conditioner and love it! I have very thick hair, and this helps tame it without looking greasy. I wash it with castille soap first then use the coconut oil.<br /><br />Be aware that this does smell like coconut while I have tried others that do not. I love the smell, but it may turn some off."
1106,B003B3OOPA,4,little pricey but taste good,"This coconut oil taste good, with the special coconut flavor you can feel of the really coconut (I'm a coconut lover and ate a lot of coconuts before). I bought it as a deal and found that the coconut oil was really good for health. And my friend told me that it can help prevent the pregnancy marks, but I never have a chance to try it myself.<br /><br />It's a little pricey but worth a try."
1107,B003B3OOPA,5,"must try item, highly recommend to my family and friends","I have been using this stuff for 2 months and I absolutely love it for cooking.  I also use it for my body, face and hair.  Not sure about all the healthy hype but it is a must try product.  You do have to get use to the consistency depending on the weather it could be in a liquid form or hard.  It is a great moisturizer I have very dry skin, after 2-3 minutes you no longer feel oily and the slight smell of coconut also disappears.  I do moisturize before I go to bed not sure if I would do it in the morning before I get dress for work, I would be worried it might ruin my clothes.  So far I don't see any oily stain on my clothes of bed sheets. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3OOPA"">Nature's Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce</a>"
1108,B003B3OOPA,5,Made my hair so soft!!,"I used this once on my hair and it worked like a charm!! Dandruff is diminished, and its so soft and smooth!  would definitely buy again."
1109,B003B3OOPA,5,SMELLS OUTSTANDING!!! NEVER SPELLED ANYTHING LIKE IT!!,This is my first experience with coconut oil. It's amazing. OMG...It smells heavenly. I will always come back here and purchase this. I've been missing out!<br /><br />Love it!!!<br /><br />Oh and I love the way it's packaged. That's very smart to put it in plastic<br />just in case there are any accidents.
1110,B003B3OOPA,4,just like expected,"It is a good coconut oil, at room temperature is clear, it does have a light coconut smell to it, so I mostly use it for baking sweets."
1111,B003B3OOPA,5,Love coconut oil!,"This oil is very moisturizing! It arrived in liquid form and I'm not sure if that is how it's supposed to be but I just put it in the freezer for a few minutes to harden it a bit. Smells amazing, just like real coconut. Great conditioner & it tastes good as well. I think I'll try cooking with this next! Very pleased"
1112,B003B3OOPA,5,GREAT!!!,"Keeps my hair soft and moisturized. I use it as a sealant after I condition and I reapply throughout the week. I haven't noticed any build up, it just melts into my hair."
1113,B003B3OOPA,5,love it,wish that i could add more stars to this product... this is by far the best moisturizer on the market
1114,B003B3OOPA,5,surprisingly yummy!!,"I ordered this as I've read about the health benefits for my particular health problems. I figured I would have to force it down, as I don't like coconut flavor. This has a very very mild flavor. It almosts tastes like a creamy butter spread. I'm loving it. It's great for skin as well, although I recommend if you're getting this for eating and skin/hair care either buy 2 different tubs, or take out some and put it in a seperate container for your skin care. You don't want to have germs in it. I think it's a great price for a great product."
1115,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious and good for you,Heard about the benefits of coconut oil on the Dr. Oz show. I tried several other brands and Nature's Way Organic just tastes better.<br />Especially delicious in stir frys. I buy it in bulk through Amazon which saves money. Good product and great service!
1116,B003B3OOPA,4,Worth the money,"Great value! Great product!  This oil is great for hair.  I use this for my natural 4b/4c hair.  It works well and love the natural coconut smell it leaves in my hair.  Like any oil, it turns liquid when in warm environments.  Although its messy, I like it in liquid form."
1117,B003B3OOPA,5,The many uses of coconut oil...,"I purchased this item about a month ago. I wanted to wait until I had an opportunity to really use the product in many ways and to gauge the results.  I started out taking tablespoon as soon as I purchased it...and soon discovered that other reviewers are correct - some people have to work their way up to taking a tablespoon. Now I take a table spoon in the morning mixed with a protein shake. Sometimes, I mix it in hot coffee or tea. I have also started taking an additional tablespoon in the afternoon either spread on crackers or a small piece of bread.  As a food, it gives me an extra boost of energy and seems to make me more alert.  I have begun to lose weight but I am not certain if this is because of the coconut oil or because I have implemented a walking routine. Either way, it gave me the energy to want to get up and get moving! I also use it as a moisturizer on my skin. It does go on rather oily, but it absorbs quickly. I just have to make certain that I give myself enough time for the oil to absorb before putting on certain fabrics. I was in awe regarding how soft my skin felt. Rough patches are now smooth.  I have stopped using a popular African American hair moisturizer on my son's hair and began using this.  All I can say is his hair loves coconut oil. It improved his texture.  I have also used it on an area of his head that seemed prone to razor bumps.  It is healing well. Finally, I read that this is safe for dogs.  I gave some to my dog and now he demands it each morning. He loves it too."
1118,B003B3OOPA,5,awesom!!,"This stuff is awesom!! I use it on my hair and as a body moisterizer ,leaves my skin soft and my hair shiny .  i will be ordering some more very soon :)"
1119,B003B3OOPA,5,Smells fresh and moisturizes well,"This oil smells like fresh coconut, which is what a good-quality coconut oil should smell like. It had a few pieces of real coconut floating at the bottom, which actually made it feel much more ""authentic"" to me. Interestingly enough, it arrived in liquid form (it's hot here) and I slathered it on my elbows right away. It worked great! Softened and smoothed them and got rid of that leathery feel. Can't wait to use it as a full-body moisturizer after a shower (just not on the face--never put coconut oil on the face if you don't like clogged pores)."
1120,B003B3OOPA,5,Love Coconut Oil,"I have bought several brands of coconut oil, but this one is Pure, has an excellent taste.  Coconut Oil has a million uses.  Don't hesitate to buy this product."
1121,B003B3OOPA,5,great for diaper rash and whatever ails you!,"I bought this product because I read that organic coconut oil helps heal and sooth diaper rash.  Not only did it work amazingly, but I love how it smells. I've used it on my baby for massages and an all-over moisterizer.  It also worked when my baby had a little bit of dry scalp.  I have used it in for me in my hair as a de-frizz serum, on knees and elbows for healing really dry skin, and also as chapstick.  Great product at a great value!"
1122,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful stuff!,"I use this coconut oil on my face and body as a moisturizer and I love it!  The smell is wonderful (yes, it smells like coconut).  It arrived as a solid but if I put it in the sun or set it in some warm water it becomes a liquid oil. I find I can put it on my skin in either liquid or ""solid"" states because even solid it is still very soft."
1123,B003B3OOPA,5,"Good quality, good price",I bought this at a extremely low price on Amazon.... GREAT way to stock up. I love coconut oil and it's many many uses.
1124,B003B3OOPA,5,delicious!,This stuff is amazing! It can be substituted for any kind of oil and it adds the delicious flavor of coconut. This stuff turned ordinary box brownies into extraordinary!
1125,B003B3OOPA,5,Yummy,I just got the oil and tasted it and it is great.  We will mix it with some coconut oil that doesn't have a flavor so that it all has the flavor.  Then we will continue to buy this kind.
1126,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,"This product is pricey, but is a much healthier alternative to many other cooking oils. I used it in my hair conditioner, my lotions, and for cooking and it works great for all. I even brushed about a teaspoon into my dog's fur and it made her coat softer and shinier and helped her to smell much better. I am happy to have purchased this item."
1127,B003B3OOPA,5,Great in smoothies!,"I didn't realize that coconut oil could be used as a moisturizer? I put a tablespoon in my smoothies and I can't even taste it. I add it because of the health benefits for your immune system, maintaining cholesterol levels, prevention of other illnesses & I thought I read somewhere that it helps alleviate stress. I like this brand, and it's organic."
1128,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing,"I could just eat this out of the jar. It's so full of flavor, aroma and not greasy, just light. Flavor in cooking is very light. Bought another pricier brand at the same time to compare -- This one beat it hands down. SO good."
1129,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this stuff!,"Great product, received in a timely fashion.  Not to heavy, doesn't sit on the skins surface.  It absorbs quickly and goes on smoothly."
1130,B003B3OOPA,5,LOVE the smell,"This is a great oil.<br />I have used it for my face, under-eyes, body and hair.<br />I haven't used it enough for cooking to say anything about that.<br />its super moisturizing and absorbs quickly.<br /><br />my husband has used it to style his hair, and he liked it!"
1131,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconot Oil is Amazing!,"Purchased this item, and I am happy with the results. I have been using the oil both in my hair and on my skin and there is such a stark contrast from  being dry  to moist, especially my hair.  I am pleasantly surprised by the results and thanks to the reviewers who shared their experiences. In addition, I also like the smell of the coconut oil."
1132,B003B3OOPA,5,"Great Quality, Great Price","Everyone seems to be catching on to the healthy benefits of coconut oil.  I use it for cooking, drop a plop into a smoothie, use it on my skin and hair...all great so I won't revisit all of that.  This product specifically is a very high quality and the price on Amazon is phenomenal. It arrived promptly and in good condition.  Nature's Way sells some great products.  This is no exception."
1133,B003B3OOPA,5,Nutiva fan now in love with Nature's Way!,"When buying coconut oil, I often research every option possible and compare the price per ounce.  I make and sell granola and need to get the best price possible without sacrificing quality.  I decided to try a jar of this, because it was the lowest price, yet still organic and extra virgin.  I am so glad I did!  I actually prefer it, because it stays liquid until you open it.  In order to use coconut oil in my granola, I have to melt it first.  This brand, I did not have to melt first, only if I used some from an already-opened jar.  So it is just fine with me, actually better, that it comes in small jars. I ordered quite a lot more after trying it, afraid the price would go up after all the EVCO fans caught on to the deal.  Thanks, Nature's Way, I love it!!!"
1134,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this!!,If you are looking for an oil that is paleo friendly and tastes great this is it. Tastes great cooking with this as well as making popcorn with it. Great product.
1135,B003B3OOPA,5,Heaven in a jar!,"This is my first coconut oil buy and I am so glad I did! I bought it for external use, and I love love love rubbing in on my skin and how it feels afterwards. It smells great and I can't wait to use it in my body butter recipes. I've not used it for cooking yet, but I am intrigued at the thought."
1136,B003B3OOPA,5,Miracle Stuff!,"It cured my dry, itchy, bumpy skin (arms & legs) by second day - just use it like lotion after shower while skin is still moist/damp (I used loofah scrub first).  My skin feels like baby skin and itching is gone.  It really smells nice after soaking into your skin, which happens pretty quickly, and greasiness is gone - I can't stop smelling my arms.<br /><br />Also use this in cooking a lot.  It was great with banana bread - just substitute 1/4 to 1/2 of melted butter called for in the recipe (don't substitute all the butter, I believe the bread will be drier if you just use coconut oil).  As a kid, we used pure coconut oil as hair conditioner in my hometown.  So tonight, I will use it on my heels because they are always dry since I wear sandals a lot.  I bought this in Amazon a while back and it was very cheap compared to WholeFoods price."
1137,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful EVCO Product,"This is my first time purchasing coconut oil, and I have no prior experience with it.  It is white and in solid form, but easily liquifies in the palm of your hands, and it has a light and very pleasant coconut smell to it.  It tastes good (a light coconut flavor), but I use this product mainly for my hair, nails and skin.  It makes my skin soft, and my nails and hair are subjectively stronger and healthier looking."
1138,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing!!,"OMG!! I love,love,love this coconut oil. I use this for my hair and skin. I even used this for athlete's feet, this amazing oil cleared up my athlete's foot in one day. I will be using this for the rest of my life and i highly recommend it. I am also going to try it as a food supplement."
1139,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,i love this coconut oil its smells nice and is a great conditioner. wonderful product and consistency is very good.
1140,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil,I use coconut oil for just about all my oil needs.  I love it.  Received this order in just a few days from Amazon.  Will no doubt buy it again.
1141,B003B3OOPA,5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT. GREAT PRICE!,"Got this in the mail last week. It exceeded my expectations. Smells great, feels great. So many uses. For organic the price and quality can't be beat. I highly recommend."
1142,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil,I love this product. I am already almost out of it and need to order more. Shipping was fast. Thank you
1143,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut Oil InTwo Days.,"I Love It I Want To Say I Recieved Coconut Oil And  With In Two Days I Felt More Energy I was Not Tired.I Use Coconut Oil For My Cracker, Put It On  My Food Dish  To Cook With It.I Am Please With It And Happy What I Have Purchase."
1144,B003B3OOPA,5,Good Value for Coconut Oil,"taste i would say is mediocre but this item is a good value on Amazon.unbelievably fast shipping-arrived in MA from NJ in less than 48 hrs after placing order. ordered on sunday night, received on tuesday afternoon...wow...product as described, packaged well, great price and only $.99 shipping cost. The Vitamin Shoppe via Amazon - Highly recommended. The other coconut oil I would recommend is: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00115X9Q0"">Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a>"
1145,B003B3OOPA,3,It's a Liquid?,"I'm confused. I planned to use this product in place of butter and as a lotion. Unfortunately, it arrived in a liquid form. I guess our climate is still too warm. I put it in the refrigerator but it got way too hard. I love the potential, but not sure it's really going to work for me. For now, I've been spooning it on my pancakes and bagels, and it tastes just fine. Hopefully, it'll act a little more like butter in a couple of months when the house cools down to around 70 degrees."
1146,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product,"I really like this product.  I sometimes eat it spread on an English muffin and I have cooked with it.  It has a light coconut taste.  Very, very good! I will buy it again."
1147,B003B3OOPA,5,Love it!!,I quit using lotion on my face and switched to this. I now rarely ever break out. I love in az so this is great for an all over moisturizer.  Smells yummy too!  This is a great product with a great price.
1148,B003B3OOPA,5,Yummy!,"Upon opening, I immediately loved the smell! I love coconut so I was very pleased with the taste too! So far, I've put it on my neck, my hair, added to my rice, some milk, and some ice cream. Oh, and I've also gargled with it! I am excited to find many uses for this yummy stuff! I'll post an update about how it well it works when I've used it more."
1149,B003B3OOPA,3,just ok......,This product was just okay. i expected something great with all the hype and positive reviews. Most of the jar is still in my cupboard it is nothing more special than the cheaper brands that i use. I mainly used it in my skin and hair. I will now give it to my dog for her good health.
1150,B003B3OOPA,5,"Stained bedsheets, but overall good for face/neck area","I was very excited when I had read all the reviews, and so far no negative comments.<br />I experienced a slight break out , but nothing to worry out, as many others stated, definitely sticking with it. As it feels very smooth on your face.<br />Just try out how much to use, not more then half of a small nail size for sure, otherwise it will be to oily.<br />I was reluctant to try tasting it, but it really tasts very good, unless you hate coconut.<br />Will definitely try it for cooking as I have two different containers.<br /><br />When I had a small acne breakout, and one of those undercover pimples that threaten to come out and stay around for days it was gone in 3-4 days and never surfaced. So so far very good. Will keep using it and update accordingly.<br /><br />Only thing I want to caution everyone, after showering I decided to use it as all over body oil, I recall rubbing it in , but obviously not good enough , as I did go to bed an hour or so later, and the next morning I noticed dark grey stained spots on the bedsheet, I tried to wash them and use stain remover but no luck, I also saw there were some stains on the bathrope. So just be cautiouse when you apply it, how much etc."
1151,B003B3OOPA,5,GREAT MOISTURIZER-NON GREASY FEELING,"I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIS TO MOISTURIZE MY HAIR. IT REALLY IS NOT AS GREASY AS PEOPLE WOULD THINK. WHEN YOU FIRST APPLY IT YES IT DOES FEEL GREASY, BUT IT ABSORBED LIKE A LOTION DOES! MY SKIN IS SO SOFT RIGHT NOW, AND NOT OILY. I DID PUT SOME ON MY FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WILL DO AN UPDATE TO LET YOU KNOW IF IT MAKES ME BREAK OUT!"
1152,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Product!,I bought this product while searching for organic coconut oil for my hair. The price was great for this size compared to others. It works very well in my hair. It's a wonderful daily moisterizer. I am not a fan of it on my skin...for my skin I prefer sweet almond oil. I have also used it in desserts. Pretty flavorful. I'd recommend it.
1153,B003B3OOPA,5,Just what I was looking for in coconut oil!,"I've been having trouble finding affordable coconut oil in my area, and so I ordered Nature's Way, based on the reviews and price. I love the product and I got a good deal on the price due to subscribing to it. Highly recommend."
1154,B003B3OOPA,4,the oil is good....,"love the oil. but i hate the jar, whenever i try to pour out some of the oil it spills every where. for this reason going 2 try another brand next time."
1155,B003B3OOPA,5,Wonderful stuff,"This is the first time I've tried any coconut oil, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I really, really like this stuff. It lives up to all the hype, and I assume it's as good for me as everyone says. It's solid at room temperature, easy to scoop and spread, and has a great, mild flavor. I've tasted it plain, added it to smoothies, spread it on bread, and used it in place of butter for cookies. Very versatile."
1156,B003B3OOPA,5,Better than I thought it would be,"I was skeptical of the difference in all natural organic and the stuff you get from a regular grocery store.  I bought other coconut oil mostly due to the fact that it was the same price as olive oil and I thought it was ""all natural"" as it basically stated it on the container.  After reading reviews of the other stuff I bought not being organic I decided to give this a try.  While this is definitely pricier, the difference is astounding!  If you like the taste of coconuts, this is the bomb.  The other tasted nothing like coconuts, or really anything at all, so when I opened the container of this I was quite intrigued.  I put this on vegetables and when I cook fish and it definitely helps with the vegetables since I have to generally force myself to eat them.  With that said, I don't think I would buy this product again simply due to price.  I would go to another brand assuming they are as good since you can buy much more for only a little bit more in cost.  This changed my whole view toward organic, and hopefully makes me healthier.  If you read this review look at all the stuff they put in processed food ... specifically benzene!  I work in chemical plants, so I know how terrible this stuff is, and the fact they use it in food processing blows my mind!  Also, the fact that they don't have to tell you is even crazier.  There is no way this type of stuff doesn't harm you!"
1157,B003B3OOPA,5,healthy cooking oil alternative,"Not much to say but, this is good stuff,EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz. for a good price."
1158,B003B3OOPA,1,Plastic Container,"I ordered this thinking it would come in a glass jar.  I was disappointed to see that it comes in a plastic container.  It is labeled as recycling #1 (PETE), which from what I have read can leach phthalates when left in the heat (which is was, since the package was left on the porch in the sun and who knows where it was before that).  I don't like to take my chances with chemicals leaching into a product that I want to put on my skin and in my food.  I tried to return it but surprisingly (and happily), Amazon refunded the money without requiring me to send this back. WOW!  Way to go Amazon for customer service.  I just think the description of the product should specify that it comes in a plastic container."
1159,B003B3OOPA,2,Good until it comes back up!,"I loved this product when I initially received it.  I purchased it to use as a dietary supplement and was pleased to discover that it works wonders on hair and skin as well.  I read the label carefully because I was concerned about whether or not to refrigerate.  The label clearly said that refrigeration was not required.  However, after appx. 2 weeks of using as a daily dietary supplement, I began to notice an awful cramping, nauseous feeling not long after I took it.  It was the sickest I have ever felt in my entire life and I repeated it just to be sure that it was the coconut oil causing it and not something else I had eaten.  Same thing again.  All I can figure is the oil went rancid.  There's no other explanation for why it suddenly started causing me to be sick.  So, word to the wise, consider refrigerating this product.  I've stopped using it altogether because I now associate the smell of it with sickness. :("
1160,B003B3OOPA,5,"Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years... meaning the oil!]","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.<br /><br />In my opinion, EVAGold, and the Nutiva brand of coconut oil shown in the video, are among the highest qualities available, of life healing offerings from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of a jar of EVAGold on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust Swanson [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG"">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz Spray</a>.<br /><br />Reading Bruce Fife's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS"">The COCONUT OIL MIRACLE</a>, provided necessary information for working  with this fruit.  Reading that book also clarified my previous belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil, and in these brands' production purity [other excellent brands are also available; these two are just the ones I've used successfully so far].  My experience of using this type of cold pressed, virgin coconut oil for only 24 hours had shown results which made me feel blessed!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4"">The MAGNESIUM MIRACLE</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, could work as a catalyst for magnesium, while magnesium works as a catalyst for all other nutrients, including coconut oil, to function correctly.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my Amazon.com reviews on magnesium products and the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great Magnesium and Coconut books and products are available, easily found using search capacities.<br /><br />According to some experts, the most important thing to know about oils, fats, and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to some experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods, additives, and supplements can defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than magnesium, and in the current food marketplace and general eating habits; calcium is usually assimilated in large quantities, causing illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This situation is detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons like me who are severely deficient in magnesium is that most offerings of coconut I'm aware of hold more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.<br /><br />In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.<br /><br />Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient...<br /><br />With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some experts say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary nutrients, in order to live strong and disease free. [See my review of Dr. Dean's book.]<br /><br />Maybe magnesium seats life, coconut is the cozy catalyst, and taste buds rule!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Other excellent coconut oils available on Amazon:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />[The link above goes to the large size, the one I showed in my review on Bruce Fife's book]<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a> [This is the product used in the video here.

1161,B003B3OOPA,5,smooth and creamy!,"Really was surprised about the taste!Not what I was expecting.There may be others even better,and I will try them all.But as usual.....any thing that's good for you is expensive,That's why poor people will never be healthy."
1162,B003B3OOPA,5,"I don't eat it, but I love it for my skin and hair!","People usually use coconut oil for food consumption, but I don't because I eat low-fat and get what I need by consuming small amounts of whole nuts, seeds or avocado.  Oil is not a whole food and is pure saturated fat. You may want to debate me on this, but I am not open to change my view (I have studied up on this and know I feel much better and have more energy without loading up on lots of fat and protein).<br /><br />I prefer to use this oil for my hair and as a moisturizer for my body.  It has a great smell (I think about the coconut butter people use when they go to the beach) and it is certified organic.  It make my hair and skin feel soft and silky and lasts a long time, as I have the same container for almost a year."
1163,B003B3OOPA,2,It would have been 5 stars but a whole section of the coconut oil was missing from the jar,"I never write reviews, because I have not had any complaints on any of my products that I have purchased through Amazon.  I understand that its not just about bad reviews but good ones too, but for me the product is always great unless I am writing a review.  Thus here I am writing a review today.  I must state that if the coconut oil had not been missing an entire section of coconut oil from the right side of the jar, I would be giving this product 5 stars.  I love the taste, quality, shipping time etc., but the missing oil in the right side of the jar (the oil is solid) shocked the heck out of me.  I would have written something earlier about this, but I just haven't had the time.  Every time I look in the jar though, it still shocks me.  I wondered if it was due to the way the product was packaged.  Maybe it rolled onto its side and caused the top to be more full and the right side to be empty, however, it wasn't full to the top.  Also it's solid and I didn't order it during the warm months for it to be liquid and change.  So, yes, I feel ripped off.  However, I'm using the coconut oil because I do need it and already have it in my possession.  I will not be buying my now bi-monthly supply again through this dealer though, unless they decide to make this right."
1164,B003B3OOPA,5,good stuff,This is exactly what I was looking for and it is exactly what was described in the listing info so I am very pleased and would recommend this product to others.
1165,B003B3OOPA,5,Wish I had Found This a Long Time Ago!,"This coconut oil is the perfect moisturizer for both my hair and skin. I have been searching for a solution for dry skin and hair that did not involve a concoction slop of chemical madness. Massage this into your skin after a hot shower or before bed for great results. It also works great as a hair moisturizer and I even use it for hot oil treatment. Coconut oil absorbs very well into my hair without leaving it greasy (a little goes a long way). Make sure to put it on last as a sealant for any other moisturizers that you use. I feel a lot better knowing that something I am putting onto my skin and absorbing into my bloodstream does not contain a mass of impossible to pronounce ingredients. My only advice is that you find some kind of bottle to put it in or mix it into your favorite lotion. I rinsed out an empty shampoo bottle. I find that at room temperature, constantly dipping your hand in gets kind of messy. I love it!"
1166,B003B3OOPA,5,an excellent prodect,"When the first time I triad this coconut oil, I love it. I use it in my hair and now is much moisturizer, shiny and less shell than ever. Totally until now, I ordered 4 of this products. Highly highly recommended"
1167,B003B3OOPA,5,I first got this for baby's eczema...,"I was looking for natural moisturizers that alleviate symptoms of eczema and I came across this coconut oil.  My baby is 5 months old and after 24 hours of applying this oil from head to toe, his red patches were significantly reduced.  My whole family was amazed at the results.  No, it is not a cure but it is a good moisturizer to use on a baby with eczema, espeically for the face since my baby sucks on his hands, rubs it all over his cheeks and then takes it right back into his mouth.<br />I decided to take 3 tsps a day (now a bit more because I love the taste and texture so much) as a supplements since it has antifungal and lots of lauric acid (found in breastmilk) which strengthens the immune system.  I was hoping that some of it will get passed on to my milk and help my son fight his eczema from the inside.  Actually, I read that eating just 3 tsps a day, the lauric acid content in breastmilk jumps up from 3% to 9%.  As far as the results, I don't know if the coconut oil through my breastmimlk helped him but I sure got hooked!  I love the taste, texture, and look forward to taking my suuplemental tlbs.  I plan to bake with it this weekend and have asked my husband to use it for cooking as well.  I've rubbed some on my hands and face and it feels really soft and well moisturized.  I haven't tried it in my hair yet but plan too.  When I told my coworkers about my new obsession, they seemed a bit confused but really, read about the countless benefits and see how easy it is to substitue coconut oil for so many of your daily care and food.  I'm ordering the 54oz tub from a different brand from amazon today."
1168,B003B3OOPA,5,This is great stuff with the coconut aroma,Great stuff. I had ordered the one by NOW which is best for hands and feet. This product is good for cooking.
1169,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut,I bought this for my 73 year old dad he had seen it on a commercial and thought it looked like good stuff..he is very pleased with it
1170,B003B3OOPA,5,great stuff,I love it.  You will too.  What's not to love :)  IT IS WHAT IT IS. Nothing more; nothing less.
1171,B003B3OOPA,4,Mmmmmm!,"This product smells absolutely wonderful. I thought maybe they added fragrance, even though it was supposed to be organic...NOPE! All natural! Very moisturizing! I will be using it mainly for my natural (African-American) hair, and skin. I've only used a little, but can't wait to try it out for it's many uses. My only complaint was the packaging. The box was 6x bigger than the product. I just think it was a waste to have packaged it in such a big box. If they'd used a better choice of packaging, I would have rated it a five. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase : )"
1172,B003B3OOPA,5,AMAZING,"Trying to find a natural alternative for my acne I came across this and hooked Since my first day of college my face that was once flawless exploded into acne (I was 18 then). It hurt, throb, left scars, terrible blemishes, cystic acne along my cheek and chin area, very oily t-zone, large pores on my cheeks, blackheads and dry patchy areas. Worse thing about it I had new ones almost everyday and my chest and acne were the same.<br />Desperate I read up all the natural benefits in using coconut oil internally and externally and it i knew it wouldn't hurt to try. My face was terrible as it is. Anyway when I started applying this externally, my back and chest acne lessen within a month and a half. I have to say it didn't disappear like magic however I notice my skin felt smoother, my skin tone was more even than before,my dry patchy area disappeared and best of all less acne. But my cystic acne still kept coming.<br />So determined I changed my chemical based products into 100% natural. Basic natural cleanser, toner, and moisturizer which is my bestfriend coconut oil and also a healthy diet. Within 6 months of using this externally and internally my face is completely clear with only a once and while breakout and I'm currently 1 month away from being 20 and almost getting to flawless. Except my acne scars is a huge problem for me for the moment.<br />My sisters and I also use it for deep hair conditioning, and some facial treatments.<br />Coconut Oil is creamy and delicious as well. I love eating this with my toast and putting it in my favorite coconut chicken curry. I've noticed when eating coconut oil or just adding it into my food my appetite isn't as big as it was before. Not sure if its because its a healthy type of fat.But anyway I absolutely love, love , love this product.<br /><br />however with the acne part, its not for everyone. I'm fortunate enough that this work wonderfully for me. But it wouldn't hurt to try. Its affordable and no harsh chemicals added at all."
1173,B003B3OOPA,5,Miracle oil,"This coconut oil is sweet & delicious. I eat it straight out of the jar, use it as lotion, use it on my hair & I even put it on my dogs. They have skin issues & applying the oil topically as well as feeding it to them healed their skin in a matter of days. Using it on my face instead of lotion is clearing my combination skin up. It's like a miracle oil. Highly recommend it."
1174,B003B3OOPA,5,"Delicious and Fresh, no complaints in regards to the product quality...BUT","I love this coconut oil, I ordered 4 quantities and all of them were super fresh and tasted very delicious. The texture was great and it's a joyous treat to use every time. Coconut oil has many uses, but I use it mainly as a dietary supplement. I use it to cook my morning eggs or sauteing vegetables with the omelet, add some to my oatmeal every morning, put a little in my tea or coffee, add some to my protein or fruit shakes, or just take it by the spoonful which is melt in your mouth deliciousness.<br />I am a very active person and a health nut, and I follow a low-carb diet and way of life, so I put great emphasis on consuming lots of quality oils and fats in my diet. Coconut oil makes the perfect addition. I am 100% satisfied with the quality of this coconut oil.<br /><br />However, having said all of this, one thing that I wish was different about the product was the package. The jar is plastic and my limited knowledge in chemistry points me to the old knowledge that ""like dissolves like""... and since oils and plastics are both derived from nonpolar substances, this leads me to worry that there will be plastic leaking into the oil. Albeit this is a tremendously slow process, nonetheless it still makes me second guess coming back to this product and purchasing a brand that uses glass jars instead. If they change their packaging methods, I will have no problem purchasing this brand again. Although, I did not take off any stars for this reason because most coconut oil packages these days seem to come in plastic containers, so it wouldn't be fair to rate this brand less than others.<br /><br />One thing that I have done to lessen my worry is to refrigerate the oil so that it solidifies. My rationale behind this is that less oil is in contact with the plastic container when the oil is solidified because only the edges touch as opposed to a liquid form, which is constantly mixing and makes more surface area contact. I actually like to take my coconut oil when solidified because I like how it melts slowly when eaten and you can savor the taste better.<br /><br />I hope this helped others."
1175,B003B3OOPA,4,Great for everything,"I started using this product as a dietary supplement which boost your energy and also helps me feel fuller faster, the taste isn't bad, its just really oily. Also I love it as a conditioner, I put it in my hair overnight or sometimes for 3hours and the next morning when I wash my hair its so managable,bouncy and defines my natural curls, I am african-american and this works great on my hair especially cause my hair is really thick, also I use on my skin(face) and it make my face feel nice and smooth it gives that natural glow. I really like how fast I recieved my product and was able to keep track of it, also the sender responded in a timely manner when I emailed them so they can take the hold off, so i can pick it up at my local ups store"
1176,B003B3OOPA,5,One of my New Kitchen Staples,"There was a time when I went out of my way to avoid coconut oil - I'm not quite sure if I was confusing it with palm oil, or if medical science was actually lumping it together with all the other saturated fats as a dietary NO-NO.  Of course that's all changed now, and coconut oil is recognized as one of the 'good' oils - but it was still only recently that I had a chance to try it for myself.  Wow!  It's great stuff.<br /><br />Coconut oil has a unique quality in that it has a melting point of 76 degrees, F - and out here where I live (Oregon), that means I seldom see it as a liquid oil (even in summer) - but that's fine with me, for one of the things I like using it for is in biscuits and pie crust, and for those, it has to be solid - and as a solid fat, coconut oil is quite hard (really hard!), even when close to 75 degrees - and for that reason, it is much better for use in baking, where a hard fat works much better than a soft one.<br /><br />But another characteristic of coconut oil that I love is its flavor and aroma - when you open the jar and stick your nose down in it, you are enveloped in the beauty of the coconut's best element, its aroma - its almost frightening how beautiful that smell is.  Maybe it's just me, but that aroma literally sends me to the tropics each time I open the jar.<br /><br />And then there's the flavor.  Most fats have little or no flavor - in fact, as cooks we've been taught to use a fat with no flavor in our cooking.  However, we all know that many fats are flavor!  And if we remove the fat, we lose much of the flavor.  Well friends, coconut oil is a fat with super flavor!  Anything you make with it will have the subtle flavor of the topics - I use it when I make rice, when I do S E Asian dishes and curries, and to make great scrambled eggs.  When you begin using it, coconut oil will open new doors of creativity in your cooking - and you will love it too."
1177,B003B3OOPA,5,Delicious,I don't know about the health benefits yet. i just know it tastes great right out of the jar and spread on crackers.
1178,B003B3OOPA,5,great product,Too bad i didn't know about this stuff sooner. It has done wonders for my skin hair and nails. I don't know about cooking with it because I rarely cook but maybe in the future. I love this stuff!!
1179,B003B3OOPA,5,"Tastes Good, Great Price, May Help Your Health","I came across some research that suggested organic extra virgin coconut oil might help people suffering from Alzheimer's.  Before giving it to my parents, I decided to test it myself to see how it tasted and to check for side effects.  A visit to the health food store and I was ready to check it out.<br /><br />Honestly, it has replaced butter and olive oil in most of my applications, becoming my fat of choice.  It may all be in my head, but I am convinced I am ""sharper"" when taking it.  My parents are getting about a tablespoon a day, and enjoy it on bread as a treat.  They are more alert than they were more than a year ago - I can't prove it's because of the coconut oil, but it's the only thing we've changed.  Draw your own conclusions....<br /><br />When I found Nature's Way at Amazon, the price blew me away.  When I read about the subscription program (save some $ and get free freight), I decided to try it.  Getting 16 ounces is convenient, and having it come regularly with free shipping (even though it's less than $25) makes it a great value...and it tastes better than the stuff I'd gotten at the health food store.<br /><br />Heck, it's under $10 - give it a try!"
1180,B003B3OOPA,5,Topical miracle...!!,"After doing a lot of research on coconut oil, I knew I had to give it a try. The product arrived quickly and as a liquid (I live in FL and it is summer- i expected this), and the smell is just sooooo delicious!!I have not used it in cooking yet, as I started using it topically and want to order a separate batch to cook with, but I have to say I am completely BLOWN away by the effects it has had on my skin already. I am a fair skinned female and have always been a target for mosquitoes. For most of my life I have been embarrassed by the multiple and never ending itchy, ugly bug bites and rashes these annoying little things have left on my skin. (mostly my ankles and legs) and am sometimes reluctant to wear shorts, dresses, and things that don't cover my legs (Which can be very difficult, considering just how HOT it is in FL)because it makes me feel self conscious and less confident about myself.<br /><br />Naturally, when I received the product the first place I started lathering it onto was my feet and legs, and I continued to do this several times a day. I WISH I had taken a before and after photo, as I did NOT expect the results to turn out as they did. Within 2 days, many of the little red spots had COMPLETELY disappeared. Furthermore, the scars and marks that were left from previous encounters have started to fade and are becoming less noticeable each day. Mind you, I have only been using the stuff for about 2 weeks. But like I said, I am completely blown away by the effects thus far. Additionally, I have started to apply the oil to a few moles that I have, and am very excited to see if there are any results in a few weeks (I will follow up with this post as needed)<br /><br />I order items frequently from amazon.com, and do not have the time to review many of the things I purchase. However, the effects from the coconut oil literally seemed to good to be true and now I know why many others have felt the need to 5 star review this product as well. I am a pharmacy student who is turning more and more to alternative treatments and natural remedies every day. I can not wait to be able to educate the public in regards to products such as this. And did I mention? I wore shorts to work for the first time the other day; no more self esteem issues, and my confidence is skyrocketing :)"
1181,B003B3OOPA,5,"Great in Coffee, Oatmeal and Shakes!!","I am trying this coconut oil as a dietary supplement. By itself, 1 Tbsp tastes very rich and coco-nutty. Too rich for me so, I decided to put it in a cup of coffee. It was delicious!! I used Columbian coffee (Green Mountain, Fair Trade Select K-Cup), sugar and some hemp milk (Pacific Natural Foods). That is definitely a keeper!! If you don't drink coffee, I'm sure it would work great in a cup of hot cocoa as well.<br /><br />Later, I decided to try it in some oatmeal. I mixed the following into a cup of cooked oatmeal: 1/2 Tsp cinnamon, 2-3 Tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp coconut oil. When the coconut oil melted completely, I added 3-4 Tbsp hemp milk to cool it down. My taste-buds were amazed!! Tomorrow, I will try this with raisins. Mmmmm.<br /><br />We make a lot of fruit shakes at our house and I've had coconut in them before, so I know this will taste great in a shake too. Here's the recipe I'm going with: Banana, Cantaloupe, Orange Juice, Ice, Hemp Milk, Honey (maybe) and Coconut Oil.<br /><br />I still have to find one more meal that I can add this to in order to keep up with the recommended 4 x 1 Tbsp daily dosage, but I'm sure it will be no problem to find something else that this goes well with."
1182,B003B3OOPA,5,Used for hair/scalp,I used this to make my home made hair and scalp products. It was easy to work with melted well and solidified as expected. The smell was also as expected... Just like coconut! Will buy again!
1183,B003B3OOPA,5,Coconut oil was given a bad rep,"I was diagnosed as a borderline diabetic two years ago, and also have borderline cholesterol problems.  When going over my dietetic guidelines, the nurse suggested that I use coconut oil.  I was shocked!!!  I remember when the cholesterol police had coconut oil removed from the movie theaters because it was a bad fat.  Shows you what they new...just like they said you shouldn't have more than 1 or 2 eggs a week, or you should give up caffinated coffee.  And now they've discovered that was all a bunch of bull.  I tried to find this oil in my local Jewel supermarket today, but they had no coconut oil.  They had probably 20 different kinds of oils...ones you couldn't even imagine...but no coconut.  So, I thought...hmmm..I'll bet Amazon has it.  I can't wait till it gets here so I can have my favorite snack made just a little bit more healthfully...popcorn."
1184,B003B3OOPA,5,Yummy coconut oil!,"After being refered to this product, I looked everywhere for it.  This is a wonderful thing for the body, both outside and in."
1185,B003B3OOPA,4,coconut oil...,"I am very happy with this product.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is also a quality product."
1186,B003B3OOPA,5,wonderful oil,I loved this oil. I have never seen an oil like this with a good smell. I couldn't believe it's gonna be like this and my hair smells coconut.
1187,B003B3OOPA,5,SMELLS WONDERFUL-NOT IN A GLASS JAR,"SMELLS WONDERFUL-BUT NOT IN A GLASS JAR<br />HAVEN'T USED IT MUCH YET, EXCEPT FOR ""OIL PULLING"" SEE SHOW ON THE NaturalNews Talk Hour, Dr. Bruce Fife (reveals the amazing power of coconuts) SORRY THE REVIEW ORIGINALLY SAID GLASS JAR SO I CORRECTED THAT"
1188,B003B3OOPA,5,Great!,This is very good product for people trying to get rid of bad bacteria naturally! Take 3 tbs a day.
1189,B003B3OOPA,1,Quality Is Questionable,I really didn't care for this brand compared to other unrefined coconut oils I've been using. It's not USDA approved and the scent smelled artifical. The texture was heavier then most unrefined coconut oil. When I oil pulled using this brand my results were not as great either. I believe Nature's Way brand is natural but certainly not organic. I will be going back to Spectrum's brand.
1190,B003B3OOPA,4,Bummer plastic container!,"Bummer! Plastic! However, I can't wait to use it in my hair and skin...perhaps cook with it and ingest it as well. I see the benefits are amazing for us! We shall see-"
1191,B003B3OOPA,3,The smell was too strong for me,I purchased this due to my use of coconut oil products in my hair. I am currently using the Coconut Oil by Organic Root Stimulator and decided to go with something more natural since ORS contains petrolatum. While I'm sure this product works great I cannot attest to that because the smell was nauseating to me. If you love the strong smell of coconut then this may be for you.
1192,B003B3OOPA,3,Consistency of wax,I was surprised to find that I had to actually chip this product to get any out of the container.  It is like hard wax.  I've read the reviews about being able to use it as a spread or to take a spoonful from the jar and eat it.  Did I just get a bad jar of it or do I need to do something to it so it softens up?  I don't want to give the product a bad review if it's just a bad jar so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
1193,B003B3OOPA,5,luv luv,"this stuff is awesome just got back from the beach and it worked great as a sunscreen..no burn..wonderful,i have also been taking a spoon on my morning toast i am addicted.luv luv..."
1194,B003B3OOPA,2,Liquid not Cream,"I have this product set up to automatically ship every two months.  I have received several shipments and they all were creamy.  However, my last shipment was in liquid form.  I mix the coconut oil with products for my hair so I like the creamy formula.  Depending on your use, the liquid may work for you."
1195,B003B3OOPA,3,Plastic jar,"The coconut oil smells nice and looks like its of high quality, but with high quality content, I demand high quality packaging... the oil came in a plastic jar and the lid was messy as it did not screw on properly from the first try"
1196,B003B3OOPA,2,not what i expected,"It is definitely not the item that will save me from buying conditioner and hands cream. The item arrived safely. The plastic jar was not a problem. However, in terms of helping for disentangling hair and making it brighter (as a regular conditioner would do), reasons for which I bought it, this product did not work. I tried to put the 1.5 tsp, 1 tsp, 0.5 tsp and it did not help at all. I tried to wash once with shamppo, twice, putting soap on dry hair, etc but the result was always the same: very dull hair and difficult to comb. It did not help either as a skin softener at all for soap-dried hands. It absorbs quickly but feels sandy and the effect was unnoticeable. The flavor/smell of this coconut oil may be good for preparing sweets only."
1197,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Coconut Oil to use,"This product is great to use if you want to deep condition your hair and scalp with it.  I used the coconut oil along with the Suave Professional hair conditioner, put a plastic cap on my head and sat under the hair dryer for thirty-minutes with the hair dryer on the low setting, and noticed that my hair was much softer and easier to manage.  I have been natural for about a year and six months or longer (without a perm in my hair).  Since I noticed a difference in my hair I wanted to make sure that my hair was softer because of the coconut oil, because I had just started using the Suave Professional conditioner; so when it was time to shampoo my hair again, I put the same conditioner on my hair sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the setting on low as usual without the coconut oil on my hair and noticed that my hair was not as soft as when I used the coconut oil on my hair in addition to the conditioner.  My hair was still soft, not to imply that Suave Professional is not a good conditioner and didn't make my hair soft.  However, my hair seemed much softer when I used the coconut oil and the conditioner on my hair.  It is also great to use on the scalp as well.  Usually when I grease my scalp with sulfur 8 fresh hair & scalp conditioner (in the yellow jar with the blue cap) after washing and conditioning my hair within three to four days I wash and grease my hair again because my scalp no longer feels clean.  Since I started greasing my scalp with the coconut oil first, just a very little on the scalp area, then put the sulfur 8 fresh hair and conditioner on my scalp on the same scalp area where I put the coconut oil, my scalp feels healthier; after only two treatments of greasing my hair with the coconut oil and sulfur 8.  I am assuming that using the coconut oil with any conditioner and any hair grease will make the hair and scalp feel healthier, softer and easier to manage.  I highly recommend using this product or any other coconut oil if you want to use the product to help with the conditioning of your hair and/or scalp."
1198,B003B3OOPA,2,Wishy Washy,"Well when I recieved my order it was liquid, understandable because of the heat. I originally bought this for weight loss it has given me a little more energy, enough for me to start exercising again, however I gained 3 lbs that I had just previously lost before taking this. So that was upsetting. The funny thing is I only take like a teaspoon in the morning with my coffee. So if anyone is reading this, can you please let me know if I am wasting my time trying to loose weight with this or if it's normal to gain weight first before you loose it? I have only been taking it a week. I have tried to use it as a moisturizer as well, it does absorb nicely after 5 minutes but my fine lines are more noticeable. Any suggestions?"
1199,B003B3OOPA,3,Coconut Oil,"I bought this item for my hair. I've never eaten nor smelled coconut. So I thought what the hay let me try it. I thought it would be a pleasant smell, but in reality I can't stand it. It seriously makes me want to gag, throw up & die. Okay that's a little exaggerated but SERIOUSLY. It makes me super nauseous & gives me a head ache when I inhale it. I have to mix it with other hair products to ease the smell.<br /><br />On the other hand, this product really has made my hair a little more manageable.<br /><br />BTW a little about me:<br /><br />-Female<br />-18-26 years old<br />-hispanic<br />-curly, fine, dry hair<br />-a lot of split ends<br />-washed daily<br />-takes half a year to grow an inch of hair (seriously)<br /><br />I bought this product to make my hair less dry, & to help it grow and become healthy<br /><br />So far ive been using it 2 times a week for 3-4 hours & it leave my hair soft to the touch."
1200,B003B3OOPA,1,1/4 of oil  leaked out,The lid was not secured and the package arrived with about 1/4 of the oil already leaked out.I am bummed out and feel sort of ripped off.
1201,B003B3OOPA,3,Icky!  LOL,"I have been taking Virgin coconut oil in capsulated form for sometime, and had heard that taking it this way was so much better for you.  I read in the reviews that it tasted great.. Not.  In fact the texture freaked me out beyond belief.  I understand that a person can use it for cooking, but I haven't tried that yet."
1202,B003B3OOPA,5,Muy bueno,"Honestamente este aceite de coco, no tiene que envidiarle nada al ""Barlean's Organic Oil"", ambos tienen el saber muy similar la unica diferencia que encontre fue el precio."
1203,B003B3OOPA,1,Horrible!!!,"I expected the product to be something entirely different from what I received. The minute I opened the seal to see what it looked like, the smell slapped me dead in my face. The smell was so bad that I ran to wash my hands and I refused to put that in my hair or on my skin. It melted into basically water, as for that part maybe that was expected to happen because it's an oil. On the other hand, the smell I doubt was supposed to be that potent and bad. I will be throwing it away because I cannot use it or give it away to anyone."
1204,B003B3OOPA,3,Coconut Oil for your skin,This product is extremely oily but does soak into the skin after a few minutes.  The fragrance is nice but I don't believe I would buy it again.
1205,B003B3OOPA,3,Good product but bad S/H,Unknowingly ordered this thinking it was a great deal until I saw the S/H charge when I got the package OMG. 11.35 to ship
1206,B003B3OOPA,3,EfaGold Coconut Oil,"I got this coconut oil for my baby's diaper rash because we use cloth diapers. I don't think it has been terribly effective for its intended purpose, as it doesn't really clear up the rash quickly. Also, it's very liquidy in even slightly warmer temperatures and tends to make a mess everywhere as it spreads upon contact with body heat.<br /><br />However, it smells very good, and I've used it in the kitchen for cooking as well."
1207,B003B3OOPA,4,Better Before the Price Increase,It sure tasted better before Amazon raised the price. I hope this stuff is good for you - you can get different opinions. But put it in your hair? What a waste.
1208,B003B3OOPA,3,Just what i needed,These plastic caps are just what I need for deep conditioning. They came in a timely fashion and have not ceased to be a apart of my hair care regimen.
1209,B003B3OOPA,3,"So So Product, But Great Customer Service!","I was rather disappointed with this product. First, it arrived totally melted and liquified. To the company's everlasting credit, they gave me a full refund. The level of customer service was excellent. But I found this product to be greasy and unwieldy. I used it as a body lotion, but felt slimy. I also tried to massage it on my cat (who usually enjoys a 'kitty spa experience') and he ran from me. This is not a product I would order again, although I believe this is an awesome company."
1210,B003B3OOPA,2,Half the jar was solidified,"I wanted to make some protein bars at home that were lower calorie and didn't have all the fillers, and the recipe called for coconut oil. I used subscribe & save - so it was cheap. I was expecting a glass jar, but was disappointed when it arrived in a plastic jar (BPA, anyone?). From the outside, it looked like the oil had separated and that some had settled in the bottom. When I stuck a spoon in, I found it was hardened/had solidified on the bottom. I was able to break it up into smaller chunks, but it wouldn't dissolve. The oil I was able to get out of it worked, but I'm disappointed with the quality of the one I received. Too cheap to be worth returning."
1211,B003B3OOPA,5,Great Unintended uses!,"I'll keep this short, this product is great. Best anal lubrication money can buy. I'd like to warn people however, this term ""extra virgin"" does not give one their virginity back nor grant them powers over anal virgins."
1212,B003B3OOPA,3,???,I bought this and I could not recall why.  When I use it for cooking it makes the food taste like coconut.  So cannot see using it a lot.  I love coconut but not on quesadias.  Instead I ordered coconut pills.
1213,B003B3OOPA,3,It has good and bad points,"This ""oil"" is supposed to be a healthy oil with many uses, that's the GOOD.  What I don't like about it is the packaging.  Once it solidifies, it's a greasy mess to remove from the container.  Making it in a ""squeeze bottle"" would make it MUCH easier to use, hence I'd get more use from it!"
1214,B003B3OOPA,1,Unhappy Customer....false advertising,"I saw that the price advertised for the ""Subscribe and Save"" was $6.79($0.35/oz).  Since that was a good deal I ordered it.  After I placed the order I did the math on my own and realized that it is actually $.43 per oz.  If I would have done the math before, I would not have placed the order.  I am very disappointed that the would lie about the price."
1215,B003B3OOPA,5,Amazing,"This oil is AWESOME! It solidifies in the appropriate temperature and does amazing things to my hair. I slept with the oil from the middle to my ends for several nights and already felt as though my ends were stronger and healthier.<br /><br />I didn't use it for cooking, as most reviews I've read did, but I DID use it in:<br /><br />- my long Asian locks<br />- my hot sultry baths (yummy!)<br />- and my skin<br /><br />ALL of which were incredibly beneficial! PLEASE try! Such a good deal, lasts forever -- As I live in Santa Barbara and have access to some amazing beaches, I EVEN used it for outdoor tanning!"
1216,B003B3OOPA,4,Not the best,"I could not figure out what the difference was between this product and the one I have been using.  This comes in a 16 oz. plastic jar, mine comes in 14 oz jar.<br />this one is less expensive, that is where I get nervous.  So I examined both jars, this one has 10 more calories than mine for each tablespoon.<br />This one has 13 grams of saturated fats and mine has 12.  None of these is a problem ans is well within range, then I noticed this one can be cooked up to 350 degrees.<br />Mine can be cooked no higher than 280, this means that this one is refined,  mine is unrefined, this one is more processed.  Not what I want.  I am sure it is not a huge deal but I want the best I can get.  With all that said, I really cannot taste a very big difference between the two, I did a side by side taste and texture taste and they are close to being identical.<br />There is a lovely coconut flavor and a nice oil taste.  The coconut did not overpower the foods in my recipes which I thought it would.<br />I used it on my face hair and body.  It is cooling and smooth, it does take a little time to soak in so I use it at night and in the morning I feel silky smooth.  It has not clogged my pores so I wake up and there are not blemishes.<br />It is also extremely good for your pets, cats dogs and birds.  My dog absolutely loves this but be careful you must start by giving a very small amount (1/4 tsp.)and build it up to a tsp. per 20 lbs. of animal over a month.  If you are not careful they will suffer from die back.  Google that, you may see Herxheimer's reaction, it is about the same thing and happens to humans also.  I had it once it is not pretty, although it is very good sign in the long run.<br />I like this product but I will stick to my unrefined brand."
1217,B003B3OOPA,5,"Curbs Your Appetite, Gives You Energy & Makes You Regular!","I decided to order this product after reading a few books about the benefits of coconut oil.  I received this product about two weeks ago & here are my observations:<br /><br />1)  It totally curbs my appetite and gives me a sense of satisfaction so I don't have to eat every couple of hours.<br /><br />2)  It gives me so much energy!  I usually have to drink two cups of green tea to get me going & maybe a cup of coffee if it's a very busy day but since I started using coconut oil, my energy level is higher and I get a lot more done without burning out.<br /><br />3)  It made me regular, not to be too detailed but you will have a movement after almost every meal.<br /><br />4) No morning breath!<br /><br />5)  Soft, silky skin & hair.<br /><br />6)  No toothache.  I had a cap that came loose so I had my dentist bond it back on but it kept bothering me as if it was infected or something but since I started using coconut oil, whatever was going on is totally healed.<br /><br />We are on our 2nd bottle already!  I love it so much I also use it as moisturizer, just be careful when applying it to your shoulders, especially if you have long hair, it will make your hair greasy.<br /><br />I hope you have the same positive experience."
1218,B003B3OOPA,5,Awesome product!,"My Mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two or three years ago and didn't even seem much like my Mother anymore.  I started giving her the coconut oil slowly--just a teaspoon a couple of times a day at first, but graduated that upward to at least three tablespoons per day--and my Mother gradually appeared again.  If you have a loved one with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, you should do some research on that.  It is worth the bother!  The product smells and tastes really great!<br /><br />The service has also been great!  I have it scheduled to deliver a certain amount of the product at a certain time interval.  I don't have to bother to remember to reorder it.  It comes like clock-work!"
1219,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for hair care and for cooking,"I'd suggest to buy TWO containers, one for hair use and one for cooking use. I originally bought this to use on my daughter's hair -- she fussed a bit about leaving it in her hair for two hours, but the results were amazing, far better than any conditioner we've tried on her hair.<br /><br />I don't care for the taste of this oil on toast but it's terrific for frying -- eggs, hash browns, greasing the griddle for pancakes -- superior results, better than butter, better color, better taste. It's pretty much a 1:1 replacement for butter. Very pleased with this product."
1220,B003B3OOPA,5,Wow where has coconut oil been all my life - just Google the health benefits and be amazed!,"This is my first experience with coconut oil. I heard about it and read up online and was amazed at the health benefits. I found this brand to have the best reviews/price so I went with it. I'm getting ready to purchase my 3rd one in as many months. It has a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor and is now one of only 3 oils I use in my cooking (+olive oil, avocado oil).<br /><br />My uses:<br />-Replace butter/fat/oil for non-stick cooking - except when using olive or avocado oil, this is my go to. In the skillet before eggs/bacon/pancakes/etc.<br />-On toast/pancakes etc. as a butter replacement - that little hint of coconut is delicious and the fattiness is reminiscent of butter.<br />-A tablespoon in my smoothies (for the health benefits)<br />-Oil replacement in baking recipes - it works just as well and is healthier!<br /><br />It's important to note that in cooking, the coconut flavor does not persist. If I add it raw I get that flavor but my eggs/bacon, for example, do not have coconut flavor after being cooked in this oil.<br /><br />HEALTHY: Read up on all the health benefits but here's the main one: yes this is a saturated fat. However, it's made up of medium-chain fatty acids. This type of fat is readily converted to energy and rarely stored as fat. Research shows that coconut oil (in moderation, of course) helps you lose weight and speeds up your metabolism. A few tablespoons a day is GOOD FOR YOU!<br /><br />My only con for this product is the plastic jar/tub. I hate plastic. Glass would be nice, as always!"
1221,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for hair,"I bought this to use as a hair conditioner after reading about it in a magazine. I have long thick hair with split ends. When it came in I decided to try it. It has a wonderful nutty smell and is solid at temps below 70 degrees. I took a chunk out and rubbed it into my palms and then into my hair after shampooing. I made the mistake of just rinsing it out instead of following with another shampoo. Don't do this unless you want grease head! So, the next time I did the same thing, shampoo my hair first apply the coconut oil and allow it to sit for a while, but this time I shampooed it out. Boy what a difference! My hair was soft, shiny and manageable for the rest of the week. I now use it about once a week as a deep conditioner. Great stuff and I'm glad that I found it."
1222,B003B3OOPA,5,"Bought it for my dog, but love it for myself!","I initially bought this for my dog.  She has sensitive, dry skin, and will get rashes on her legs.  I just rub this in and wah-lah!  No more itchy skin.  Not to mention, unlike so many other products, it is completely fine if she decides to go to lick-town on it.  It also smells amazing, so it isn't a big deal if she gets it on something.  I also have dry skin, so I will rub it on my elbows and massage it into my scalp.  After that, you can put it in recipes in place of butter in order to replace some bad fat with good fat.  I am all for a product that is multipurpose and very ecofriendly.  Anytime you can go natural, you definitely should.  Maybe it's just the glue-eating kid in me, but I think it's pretty awesome that I can eat my conditioner/lotion."
1223,B003B3OOPA,5,Excellent,It's my first time purchasing this product from Amazon. I have been using this product for more than two years. It's fantastic and an excellent source for good health. I will encourage anyone to purchase this product.
1224,B003B3OOPA,4,"Feels good, tastes great!","I love the fact that I received this product in a very timely manner. I purchased this product to use on my hair and skin, but never thought of using it as a supplement. I love the consistency, the smell and the feel of this product, So, I thought I'd taste it to see how I felt about it as a supplement.  The coconutty flavor is great & I now take 1 tablespoon of it daily.  Some of the health benefits of coconut oil are: improves digestive health, strengthens the immune system, controls blood sugar etc.  I will buy again!"
1225,B003B3OOPA,5,wonderful!!,"Coconut oil is a wonderful product for African American hair and I absolutely love it. You can even use this, solely, as a deep conditioner, or melt it and mix it with your current deep conditioner to give it an extra boost.<br /><br />This seller is wonderful.  I ordered this yesterday and received it today.  Amazing."
1226,B003B3OOPA,5,...great for Hair!,"I recently bought this product after hearing great reviews on it and I can say that I definitely agree. I use this on my hair exclusively, I am an African-American and have natural hair. I usually just ""seal"" my hair with this, which it's good for, but it can be greasy. I don't really know how to combat that, but it doesn't really have too much of a smell either, which is good b/c I don't know how I feel about the smell of coconut. The amount is quite enough for the price, but depending on how much you use it may not last as long as it looks like it will. Mine probably won't last too long, but I will definitely buy again."
1227,B003B3OOPA,5,Wow!  The best smelling and tasting coconut oil yet!,"I'm very strict with my diet. I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies. This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much. Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Keeps your digestive system very clean inside. Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the ""eat every 3 hours"" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body.<br /><br />5) Tastes great. Smells great.<br /><br />6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft. Is absorbed into the skin to nourish it, unlike most cosmetic moisturizers which leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance.<br /><br />7) Can be used as a sexual lubricant. Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem.<br /><br />8) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner. Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the body's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners. Plus, because coconut is anti-""everything bad"" it will keep the hair clean too!<br /><br />9) Coconut oil detox cleanse. The medium-chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-""everything bad"" properties. The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day). The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well. You can find the instructions by Googling ""Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse"".<br /><br />Basically, coconut oil is amazing! And this brand is the best I've found so far. Enjoy!<br /><br />*** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil.

1228,B003B3OOPA,5,Cannot live without this product!,"I am in sheer heaven! It smells sooo wonderful. Not overpowering, just a subtle scent. I'm using this product as a skin softener (marvelous), hair product (so soft) and for cooking (light, tasty). Although, I have 3 different bottles for their uses. I keep them refrigerated for longevity (just a preference). I prefer the product in its solid state rather than the liquified state for use.<br /><br />Add a few drops to your lotion, use in your co-wash bottles and great when grilling foil wrapped seafoods and brush on shish kebabs and grilled veggies. Its light.<br /><br />I will remain a faithful consumer of this product.<br /><br />Nina"
1229,B003B3OOPA,5,Love love love this product!,"I'm new to the coconut oil hype, but so far I can say the excitement is totally founded.  I haven't tried it internally yet, but the external use has been amazing.  I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms (upper and lower), legs, and butt (yay, me!).  I've only ever found one cream by Lush that made any difference, and it was very expensive.  Enter, coconut oil! First, you will notice that it comes as a solid (unless the temperature is above 72 degrees, then it melts, which is ok, don't panic).  You take a bit and rub it between your hands and it melts instantly.  You're going to think first: oh yuck, I'm not putting this on my body! But please do: rub it anywhere and everywhere.  You'll notice how at firstit doesn't seem to be sinking in, but if you wait about ten minutes, it will do just that.<br /><br />I should also mention I have a sensitive skin on my face, which despite proper exfoliating, sheds skin often.  I get dry patches that, when at their worst, act like burns that open and are painful.  I know, pretty gross.  I'm usually cautious about trying new products on my face because it's so sensitive.  For years I've been using Eucerin, but it's not always enough.<br /><br />I through caution to the wind and slatered my face with the coconut oil.  It felt pretty gross at first, but within ten minutes it started to sink it.  I was nervous that I would wake up in the morning with oil-induced acne, but that didn't happen.  What did happens was that it had sunk in completely and my face was the smoothest and softest I'd ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't stop touching my face!  Of course this meant my makeup went on better, and I looked...I don't know...I guess the word is well-rested.<br /><br />Another HUGE bonus is that while the dots on my arms still look like they're there, my keratosis pilaris is all but gone!  My arms, legs, (and yes, butt) are the softest and smoothest I've ever seen them.  I can't believe this worked! As you're working the oil into your skin, don't forget to rub it into your nails and eyelashes too.  I swear my eyelashes look longer andI know my nails are definitely stronger.<br /><br />Lastly, this product is CHEAP, you really can't go wrong with it.  I have two tubs of it, one for my body and the other for my diet (the thought of using one for both grossed me out). I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Anyway, consider this a five-star, two thumbs way up review!"
1230,B003B3OOPA,5,Miracle for Your Skin!,"I bought this product after my sister gave me a sample of the coconut oil she uses, and it left my skin looking much improved after 2 1/2 years of full-time work and full-time school (plus a husband and kids) left my face broken out from stress.  Coconut oil in general is amazing!  It has cleared up about 90% of my hormonal acne and after I wash my face and use the coconut oil, my face looks so healthy, glowing, and clean.  It seems to go against all sound advice to slather oil on your face, but it really works!  My husband even uses it each night after washing, and I've really noticed a change in his skin.  I have recently been using it on my entire body and have such soft skin (elbows and knees included).<br /><br />For this particular brand of coconut oil, it doesn't seem to be much different than the sample my sister gave me (which was a different brand).  There is a good bit in the jar.  It's pretty firm, so it's a little hard to dig out at first; but once your hands warm it up a little, it softens.  I dig out a small chunk and rub it between my palms.  It melts almost instantly and is ready to rub in.  This just seems to be the right way to take care of your skin as opposed to layering chemical after chemical in hopes that something, anything will work."
1231,B003B3OOPA,5,"multiple uses, goes a long way","I have never purchased  this type of product before but I am glad I started with this one. The smell is savory coconut. I scrapped some into a small glass pot to keep in the bathroom and I take a small amount, melt it in my palm and treat my hair ends at least 3 times a week with it. I also use it for cooking (great to add to shrimp or anything you want to infuse with a little coconut essence'. Would absolutely go with this brand again."
1232,B003B3OOPA,5,Mirror Strands,"I used this product as suggested for hair conditioning.  I put the oil on for two hours before washing my hair.  I also use a little before drying my hair for moisturizer.  A little goes a long ways.  One definitely does not want to use too much of this.  I wrap my hair at night in my satin head wrap and unwrap non-greasy, extremely lustrous, well moisturized.  I am African American and naturally have dry relaxed hair, but using this routine bi-weekly, I have hair that does not sound powerfully like snapping twigs when I press it between my fingers near my ears listening for dryness.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone that suffers with dry hair especially if it has been chemically treated.  It is a hair saver.  I do shed hairs as badly as I used to.  It is hair saving."
1233,B003B3OOPA,5,Miracle Oil,"I have only been ingesting this oil and using as a moisturizer for my face, body and hair for a little over a month.  My face and body are hydrated and soft as a baby's butt.  Plus my hair is growing like a weed, soft and shiny.  My biggest thrill came last week when I walked past my entry hall mirror and noticed that the slight sagging on my jawline was firmer and I looked years younger.  When I started this Coconut Oil regimen my blood pressure was 188/92 with medication. Last week it registered 125/75 without medication.  Needless to say I am tickled at the results since deciding to take control of my health naturally and stop relying upon doctors and drugs.  My next natural health cure is switching to naturally alkaline water. I'm told that it also produces miraculous results. Does anyone know of a good brand that is at least a PH balance of 9?"
1234,B003B3OOPA,5,Lovely Product for Hair,"I love this product, but its a little strange. When it arrived, it was completely liquid. Not exactly sure why, but it was liquid for days. I liked it better this way. As it got colder it became hard as a rock. Which makes measuring it for my hair a little more difficult, but I dont care I love it. If you are using this as a hair moisturizer this feel good hands down. My hair is Shinny for the first time ever and my scalp is moisturized without feeling like it has a pound of grease on it. its light and a little bit goes a long way. I have this on autoship, but i may skip the next order because this is gonna last! I have thick hair and a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half goes a long long way. I do not feel this product on my head at all. Also works well on skin. I have dry patches on my face, this is a lovely light oil. My mom uses this product as well and she has think straight hair, and she loves it!<br />Warning, do not add too much to your scalp and whatever you do do not leave clumps of this product in your hair. If it is hard, let it warm up in your hand. Reason: I add it in clumps and as i went out in the sun it began to drip down my face like water. I can only liken the experience to Jerry Curl Juice. BUT i love this product!"
1235,B003B3OOPA,5,Don't need my eczema medication anymore,"I've mostly used this coconut oil consistently on my skin for a month now. I have eczema and dry skin spots on my torso.<br /><br />So here's my review and my experience... a rant, and advice, I guess.<br /><br />You have to be pretty consistent with this stuff to see results -- if you're starting out with it, I think. I've been using this for a month at least 2 times a day, and it's in the middle of winter when my skin easily gets dry. I stopped using lotion after learning about its ineffectiveness and how it could be in fact harmful (carcinogenic from parabens and such) -- most of the conventional products anyway that we all find easily in our supermarkets.<br /><br />So I've learned that most health products they sell you don't really eliminate the problems at their roots -- mostly just symptoms, and in fact can contribute to cancer (make-up, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, laundry detergent...) This is a very clever business technique, because the customers will always be coming back for more toxic products that eliminate symptoms, but never completely eliminate the root of the customers' problems.<br /><br />I also learned that skin problems can not only be due to toxic chemicals from your conventional lotions, it can be from toxins that sit on the inside of your body from the junk food you've been ingesting -- this includes highly processed foods, toxic medications, the toxins your skin has absorbed over the years, and maybe even the polluted air you've been breathing.(I've been told by a nutritionist that many skin problems can be helped by colon cleansing and perhaps liver cleansing...).<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that coconut oil can only do so much (at least, in my one month of experience) on the outside, it's helping just one factor out of many that would contribute to better skin health. But I'd say it's definitely better than using my prescribed topical medication which are basically steroids (betamethasone dipropionate I think). The doctor said not to use it for more than 10 days in a row (my medication), that it's bad that the skin absorbs it. *ahem* you know that doctors are not going to recommend anything other than drugs that are mostly toxic? my dermatologist was definitely giving me carcinogens, which I found out from my doctor -- so she started prescribing me steroids. that can't be good either now can it, especially when she told me that my skin shouldn't absorb too much of it?<br /><br />It's okay to absorb the coconut oil though, because it's non-toxic, nourishing for the skin, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant and can be used internally as well. So definitely, it's great for eczema. You have to be patient with it, though -- it's not harsh and strong like my steroid cream that works in minutes. The coconut oil on the first few applications within the first day or two will still leave your skin pretty dry (in my experience), but I think it's just a matter of your skin getting used to it or something. Or maybe it's a matter of getting it so that your skin is actually nourished, after all those years of using toxic malnourishing lotions.<br /><br />With acne, it's meh. I have acne on my forehead, and I learned that it's due to the oil from my hair... or, your forehead naturally produces more grease than other parts of the body. At least for me. I didn't see that big a difference with coconut oil in the past month, but I solved my acne on my forehead problem with a facial cleanse at a day spa, followed by applying organic jojoba oil on it day and night for almost a week now... and the acne's pretty much calmed down a lot.<br /><br />My face was really smooth when I consistently used the old lotions -- while I was switching to coconut oil for the first few weeks, my face was kind of dry. But now it's back to smooth, possibly even smoother.<br /><br />I bought another jar for my mom, just for general use. She used it on some sort of super itchy rash (possibly some sort of infection, I had no idea) that just wouldn't go away for months. In her experience, after applying coconut oil, her rash itched like crazy while it was greasy. But after a few days of application, it was getting better and itching less frequently. When she applied the coconut oil at night, it wouldn't wake her up anymore from the itchiness like it used to.<br /><br />I will continue to use organic extra virgin coconut oil, and stay away from toxic substances. I think I'm also going to start cooking with coconut oil as well.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut oil in my experience and/or from what I've read and researched, are:<br /><br />if you don't like the smell<br />if you're allergic<br />if you're too lazy/impatient to switch from conventional lotions to coconut oil<br /><br />Coconut oil is too good to be true. As a huge developed country we're so far removed that we had no idea that we don't really need drugs.  At least for good skin and hair and to slow the aging process, stick to organic extra virgin coconut oil. It's probably the only staple ""cosmetic"" product you'll ever need -- good health leads to beauty."
1236,B003B3OOPA,5,Love this stuff!,"This is the brand I usually purchase at the local co-op, and I am super stoked to see it here for half of what I normally pay so I just purchased two pounds. I can go through a pound in a month because I use it to make deodorant, toothpaste, to oil pull with, as a supplement, to cook with, and as body and hair moisturizer for me and my toddler. We both have very curly hair and dry skin and this is my favorite oil to use. It does have a somewhat strong scent that smells similar to buttered popcorn, haha, but I like it. No one has ever remarked that we smell bad. A few times I've been told we smell like pastry or coconut or ""something vaguely familiar"" and whenever I mention popcorn usually people agree. Anyways, I love this for first aid (rashes, cuts, burns) and to fend of sickness (often I can take a TBS and oil pull and feel better within an hour). Word of caution: take it easy if you are taking this internally at first. I've thrown up from taking too much on an empty stomach before (felt better immediately after, though). The die-off from bacteria can cause you to have ""detox sickness"". Oh! And it helps make breastmilk richer too. I really hope it will stay at this price long enough for me to make my next order. Love, love, love!"
1237,B003B3OOPA,5,Good Conditioner!,I purchased this product because I am an African American woman with 4b hair and I was loosing a lot of hair. I saw a review on this product and I decided to get it. I would have to say that it is one of my staple products now. I love it.
1238,B003B3OOPA,5,coconut oil =),"iuse this to deep condition my hair, and it makes it SUPER soft =) im starting to run low, so im going to go ahead and order more =)"
1239,B003B3OOPA,5,amazing,"I heard about coconut oil from someone on pinterest and decided to do some research on it which led me to amazon. I bought two jars of this stuff, one to keep in my kitchen for cooking,etc.  and one for personal care. About once a week I put a couple tablespoons full in a bath and wow it has done wonders for my skin. My skin is softer, I have gotten rid of most of these little bumps I had on the back of my thighs and arms. I have used it as a hair conditioner, leaving it in my hair overnight and then showering the next morning. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy. I also use it as a spread on my waffle, just a tablespoon on a whole grain waffle with some jelly, it tastes great and it good for your metabolism and health all around. it is high in saturated fat so you have to be careful but I think the good of this product out weights that. all in all I recommend it."
1240,B003B3OOPA,5,Fantastic!,Great coconut oil! Purchased this to use when making my own popcorn & it is great.  My whole family loves the taste.  After buying this I read that virgin coconut oil is the most healthy for popcorn & was thrilled to get it & see that it is virgin coconut oil.  Love it!  Hope it comes in a larger container for next time!
1241,B003B3OOPA,5,GREAT,"Felt very energized, perhaps to energized; so half a tablespoon is enough for me.  Great alternative for COFFEE!  Run much more smoothly, better skin, better hair, better eye sight, better digestion, etc."
1242,B003B3OOPA,5,"Great taste and quality, and price too","I started eating coconut oil for anti-fungus purpose. I found this great taste food. Later, I also apply it to my feet to prevent fungus growth. The result has been great. I am now regularly purchasing this product."
1243,B003B3OOPA,5,My Holy Grail,Have a complete obsession with this product. I use it every single day after the shower to moisturize my skin. Use it monthly as a conditioning treatment on my hair.  Just use caution if u go to a water park and slide down the water slides. I've never slid so fast in my life. ;)
1244,B003B3OOPA,5,Really versatile,"I've been using either Nature's Way or Nutiva coconut oil for several years, and love how versatile it is.  Not only can you use it for cooking and baking (and even around the edges of bakeware or in a frying pan in place of olive oil), but you can also use it for personal care.<br /><br />To do so, I scoop some into a small container so I don't have to dip my fingers in the larger jar.  I keep the large jar in my kitchen for cooking purposes, and then small container in my bathroom, where I use it as an eye makeup remover when I have heavy makeup on, as a skin moisturizer, and as a hair treatment.  For the hair, a small amount rubbed/melted into your palms and smoothed on over hair helps with flyaways, and a larger amount rubbed in before bed or twenty minutes before washing serves as a deep treatment. (Oftentimes, I'll put it in my hair before I go workout so that the heat helps it penetrate.)  Since coconut oil is easily absorbed by the hair, it makes for a great conditioner.<br /><br />The Nature's Way brand has consistent quality and tastes very good. It's a staple item in our house."
1245,B003B3OOPA,5,And to think this has always been around,"I love this product soooo much; I use it on my skin after a really hot bath and it just melts into your skin. It does not leave an oilly or greasy feel behind (my skin just drinks it up) and even if I don't put it on for a day or two, it still feels like I did.<br />You can eat it cause ........ well it's food and you can cook with it bake with it. I tryed it on a spoon, it has a suttle tast of an amond joy or mounds bar. Just a hint of chocolate and toasted nuts. I also use it on my hair to keep it moist since I just discovered the trend of natrual hair and hair styles for natural hair. I stopped the relxars in 1998 but was still hardheaded about the box braids etc. My stylest finally got me to understand that less is more.so for over 10 years it's just been wash consi and flat iron. I did have color put in a year ago and it's almost grown out. But I wanted to try something diffrent that I would'nt regret later. and the blow out braid out works very well for me. The Coconut oil is organic and not something you go to a hair supplie place etc to buy. I like it cause I'm feeding my hair and body with something that is natural and good for you.<br /><br />With so many natural coconut oil products out there, how do you choose?. For me I read the reviews first and then looked at the prices and checked afew other places ( okeay one ) but I can't say where. In the end I chose this Coconut oil made by natures way. ( this is my second jar, still have not finished the first jar. Second jar is in the kitchen and the first jar is in the bathroom or bedroom. I am going to buy more and I just turned my aunti on to it. She said "" My goodness, who knew and I,ve been passing by it at the food store for years""."
1246,B003B3OOPA,5,This is the best stuff ever....very pleased!!!!,"I ordered this product after reading the reviews keeping an optimistic state of mind because I am usally not a follower.  However...this product is more than what everyone say it is.  I am totally hooked.  I put this product in oatmeal, smoothies, whole wheat english muffins.  I even cook my rice in this product.  I am losing weight and enjoy the taste.  I purchase two because I also use this product on my skin in which my skin now look like a movie stars skin.  It is a bit oily however it soaks in the skin and you feel so soft all day."
1247,B003B3OOPA,4,Nice beauty product - plastic jar,"I use this as a skin moisturizer and love the way it feels and smells!  Does a good job keeping my hands moisturized.  Need to reapply a couple times throughout the day, but it's worth the tradeoff that it's all natural without any weird chemicals, unlike the lotions you find the the personal care section.<br /><br />For those that care: this comes in a plastic jar, not glass.  Since I use it topically, I don't care that much.  But if I was eating it, there are other organic coconut oils out there that come in glass containers."
1248,B003B3OOPA,5,Great for hair,"Being Indian, my mom used to always put coconut oil in my hair so it is my habit to put oil in my hair at least once a week or so. The oil sold at the stores isn't pure so I decided to buy this product on amazon. I have used 2 jars so far and I am in love with it! The oil comes in solid form and then turns into a liquid once you rub it between your palms. I warm the oil in a small container, then apply it to my hair, and leave it overnight to shampoo the next day. I also use this as a skin moisturizer in the winter. I don't use this on my face because my face is tends to be sensitive and flares up even with the most ""organic"" products. So if you are acne prone, then I would suggest testing it out before you apply it."
1249,B003B3OOPA,5,Real Coconut Oil,"This product is awesome! If you know about real coconut oil (had it fresh in the tropics), you will love this product. My sister brought me some coconut oil from NY (Jamaica's Best I believe) at the same time I ordered this product. I was a little peeved because this product cost much more than the one my sister brought me. As soon as I opened the jar though, I understood why. This is the real McCoy!!"
1250,B003B3OOPA,5,Didn't buy it for the reason you'd think,Did some research and decided to give this a try as a personal lubricant. I recommend looking it up and giving it a try!
1251,B003B3OOPA,5,Love In A Jar,"I made a few orders, this one came fast and furiously first. I ordered two jars, just in case they are small. But when the package arrived, the jars are pretty big! I opened it up, and the oil smells beautifully !! The coconut oil tastes like the almond joy. I did not really buy this for cooking but for hair and skin care and it melts on the skin like butter !!! I already love it, it smells wonderful and I will continue to use it, so that way I am able to stay away from paraben- containing hair care and skin care products. If they had even larger jars, I would order them !!! Eventually I will order more even for cooking. I really would recommend this, if you have really curly hair to use it in place of hair grease. It will even last longer and it is much cheaper, cleaner and healthier in the longrun !!!<br />I recommend this product to anyone who wants to use it what natuer already has to offer."
1252,B003B3OOPA,5,Fresh taste and good consistency - absorbs quickly into skin!,"This coconut oil is an excellent multi-purpose product.  I have used it for cooking, broiling, eating by the spoonful and as a skin moisturizer and massage oil.<br />Last night I put a few pats of this coconut oil on salmon with a salt and herb mix.  I broiled the salmon and it tasted amazing.  The coconut oil definitely enhanced the flavor.<br />I have been using this oil for frying eggs as well.  It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.<br />This coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.<br />It's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.<br />I combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.<br />It has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.<br /><br />April 19, 2012<br /><br />Still loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.<br />I packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.<br />It also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.  It smells so good that you could use it as a very mild perfume and moisturizer just by rubbing it into your arms and legs until the oil is absorbed - seriously!"
1253,B003B3OOPA,4,Fantastic for hair.  OK for dry skin,"My hair LOVES coconut oil, apparently.  I have been using a small amount in my hair after I wash and towel-dry my hair for the past 3 weeks, and my normally fine, dry hair is noticeably healthier.  It's not as frizzy and dry.  The coconut oil is actually changing my hair condition instead of just sitting on the surface of my hair and making it look glossy.<br /><br />I have tried some pretty expensive products in my hair ($20-$30 conditioners, hot oil treatments, etc.), and all I can say is, I am never going back.  My advice is to be patient with it, it's not an overnight cure, but your hair will definitely feel great over time.<br /><br />I also have pretty dry skin, but the oil seems to provide only minimal moisture for my cracked skin.  I'm sure it's great for normal skin, though."
1254,B003B3OOPA,5,Great product!!,"This coconut oil is fantastic.  I'll leave you to read the other reviews but leave you with one tip.  If you store your jar on top of the fridge, it will stay soft.  The slight warmth won't be enough to liquify it, but it will keep it manageable for scooping and such.  Enjoy!"
1255,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,I love these cookies!  Not only are they healthy but they taste great and are so soft!  I will definitely add these to my grocery list!
1256,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Anytime of Day!,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:<br /><br />--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I'd had a relatively ""healthy"" start to the day.<br /><br />--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.<br /><br />--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!"
1257,B007JFMH8M,5,Very good!,"I am usually not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these literally melt in your mouth. They are so soft and tasty! I would definitely recommend these to someone who loves oatmeal, and even those like me who would probably pick a different flavor over this one."
1258,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Oats Oatmeal Raisin Mom Voxbox Review Courtesy of Influenster,"I participated in a product review that included a sample of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH8M"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.  Okay first of all I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies and this one was no exception.  It was great!!! Soft n chewy, nice portion size and and as always a high quality product from Quaker Oats.  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster to for including this in their Mom Voxbox.  If you haven't tried it you need to and make sure to share it with the family."
1259,B007JFMH8M,5,"Quick, simple HEALTHY snack for the kiddos!!!","My kids loved these. I was very pleased to give my kids a quick on the go healthy snack before soccer and acne practice. They loved the flavor, I loved that its healthy."
1260,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,I really enjoyed these individually wrapped big oatmeal cookies. They are really soft and chewy. You can buy different flavors. I will definately be repurchasing these cookies in the future. They are delicious and super healthy too.
1261,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy,"I was surprised at how soft the cookie was. I usually buy Little Debbie's cookies, and I noticed the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was bigger and had a bold taste."
1262,B007JFMH8M,5,Wow!!!!!,Filled with oats and raisins you'll love this snack ..... Delicious and nutritious ..... what else is there to say.... you can't beat that....
1263,B007JFMH8M,5,"soft, chewy, yummy!","I was recently given a complimentary ""vox box"" from influenster, call the mom vox box. It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie ""raisins"" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets"
1264,B007JFMH8M,5,so soft and good,"the best and freshest cookie that comes in a package, we ate them up, wishing we had more. soo good"
1265,B007JFMH8M,5,Chewy deliciousness,I am a huge fan of the Quaker Chewy cookies! The moist cookies are satisfying and not too sweet. The high quality ingredients are a crowd pleaser. A must have for any car trip! After one cookie I was hooked. Highly recommend!
1266,B007JFMH8M,5,the bomb,yummy and delicious. i love eating it when it when its warm. the best store bought cookies! cant wait to buy more!
1267,B007JFMH8M,5,Deliciousness,"I received a Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie to try/eat for free from Influenster [...]). I shared the cookie with my kids, and we gobbled up the cookie faster than you can say ""Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookies."" It was soft (as advertised) and included a sufficient amount of raisins to make me happy (I like raisins). It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)"
1268,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,These cookies were so good. Can't wait to go out and buy some more! A good snack when you don't want to over-indulge yourself
1269,B007JFMH8M,5,awesome cookies,I received these in my MomVox box from influenster! I loved it! Oatmeal cookies are my favorite and these are by far the best store bought brand I have tasted! I recommend these to anyone with a sweet tooth trying to stay healthy.
1270,B007JFMH8M,5,Home-baked taste without the fuss,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies taste just like the cookies my grandma used to bake. Great to take as a quick breakfast since it is made with whole grain Quaker Oats.
1271,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Whole Grain Goodness!!!,"These cookies are a real hit with my children! I received a sample from @Influenster in my Mom Vox Box. I enjoyed the sweetness, yet whole grain taste (which I love) and the moist raisins. This cookie would be perfect for breakfast, snack, or dessert! What could be better than that?! I love these cookies and definitely will be buying more!"
1272,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker,I really enjoy Quaker's products and the fact that they are more healthy than most other products. These were really good especially if you like raisins.
1273,B007JFMH8M,5,So soft!,This was the most delightful cookie i ever tasted. I was very surprised on how soft and fresh it tasted. It makes a great snack on the go as well! I tried the chocolate almond as well and YUMMY! Quaker hit  this one out of the park!
1274,B007JFMH8M,4,On the Right Road,"Quaker used some good ingredients in the cookie and one cookie eaten amongst four kids did not meet the nutritional panel for one cookie. Even if one cookie was eaten by them each the nutritional panel was pretty good.  So, I can be a happy mom about the children eating the cookie"
1275,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,"My daughter stole it from me and ate it, I guess it's a good thing I can't stand oatmeal.  But both my kids are already huge fans of all things Quaker so it's easy for me to write this review.<br /><br />Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are chewy, nutrition and according to my kids, DELICIOUS.  They are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats, individually packaged at $2.69 for a box of 6, is a good source of fiber, only contains 6 grams of total fat per cookie and sold pretty much EVERYWHERE!"
1276,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious and healthy!,"I loved this delicious cookie! I even shared it with my 11 month old, and I'm a pretty big health nut when it comes to what I feed my daughter. It tasted great, was a great portion and it's not full of fats and sugars like all of those other cookies!"
1277,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,I enjoy these cookies... They taste like my grandmas homeade cookies.. Plump and super soft!!! I can't wait to try the other favors made by quacker.l
1278,B007JFMH8M,5,Amazing Cookies!,"These cookies have perfect flavor, excellent moist/dry combination and are very soft. They melt in your mouth. I love the taste, I could eat box after box!"
1279,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"Received this through VoxBox and loved it. My son ended up with most of it, which is fine. Excellent product to keep on hand or in the diaper bag."
1280,B007JFMH8M,5,very tasty,"I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade ""vanishing oatmeal"" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie."
1281,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful.
1282,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy in our tummy!,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these oatmeal cookies, they were delicious. It is a great go to snack when you are out and about and need something quick... and the kids love them!"
1283,B007JFMH8M,5,"I usually don't like soft baked cookies, but....","This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins"
1284,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,"I received a free sample of these cookies through Influenster and immediately got hooked on them. They're are so soft, perfect for anytime but specially for breakfast. My son loved them even though he doesn't like Oatmeal. I had to purchase more and now we treat ourselves every morning to a yummy cookie."
1285,B007JFMH8M,5,A very good Cookie!!,"I loved the texture, the natural taste, and the softness was just right!!! If you are wanting a good cookie to take o the go, or for anytime, this is a very good choice!!"
1286,B007JFMH8M,4,"Good, but not homemade.","First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar."
1287,B007JFMH8M,5,Very Good Oatmeal Cookie,"These are nice soft, spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor.  They are a perfect single serving size, in a perfect individual wrap.  They have a good taste, natural, not artificial and are a satisfying snack.  I would buy these to take for a snack or lunch."
1288,B007JFMH8M,4,Very good cookie,"Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.  Not like homemade but very good for store bought."
1289,B007JFMH8M,4,SO GOOD!,"i was surprised i liked it! i normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were sooo soft and chewy. it was delicious. i shared one with my daughter and she wolfed it down!"
1290,B007JFMH8M,2,Dry,"Oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite but I do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie.  The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but 170 for one cookie sure isn't diet food.<br /><br />2 stars."
1291,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Oatmeal Cookies,"WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, ""Mommy, can I have more?"" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies. I was very impressed with the packaging and how SOFT the cookies really were when you opened them and the flavor that they had. Very Impressive. Would definitely buy!"
1292,B007JFMH8M,4,A tasy cookie from Quaker,"Quaker products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.<br /><br />There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at: 170 calories, 6g of fat, 27g carbohydrates, 4 g dietary fiber, 12g sugar, and 2g protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.<br /><br />For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, Quaker's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!"
1293,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,This is more than just a cookie. It is a guilty pleasure. Except that you dont have to feel guilty because it is good for you. It is so soft and fresh you would think your grandma just baked it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!
1294,B007JFMH8M,5,Love the softness of this cookie!,"I received a sample pack of the Raisin variety of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster to test out with my family.<br /><br />My 22 month old son loved the cookie and almost ate the whole thing himself. I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!"
1295,B007JFMH8M,5,Love these cookies especially for the kids,The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them.
1296,B007JFMH8M,5,My kids loved them.,"My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy."
1297,B007JFMH8M,4,Lunchbox or Work Staple,"Quaker, which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness."
1298,B007JFMH8M,5,So Delious,"After trying these cookies for the first time, i am hooked and dont feel guilty because they are delicious. Thanks Quaker for another awesome product."
1299,B007JFMH8M,3,Over-Packaged Product,"In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But ""healthier"" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K"">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging."
1300,B007JFMH8M,5,yum,"I received 1 to try out and wasn't to sure what to expect. they are delicious i have to say, will definatly be buying more"
1301,B007JFMH8M,5,Great taste,Love these cookies my Son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about 15 sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel...I always make sure to keep in stock in my home...they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag
1302,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!!,These cookies are so soft and tasty. I love the texture of the cookie!! I will definitely be eating these cookies as a snack for lunch.
1303,B007JFMH8M,2,"Well, the foil packet is handy...","Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something."
1304,B007JFMH8M,5,TOTALLY DIFFERENT!,"TOTALLY DIFFERENT!<br />chewy, soft-baked cookie, Healthier alternative,<br />Individually packaged / Good for on the go!<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Great Healthier snack for all the family!<br /><br />I don't like oatmeal & raisins... but this cookie really taste great! :D"
1305,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft Baked Cookies,It is nice to have a cookie that my kids enjoy and I don't have to worry about it being unhealthy. I was very happy to receive this in my Influenster Mom Voxbox!
1306,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,I was very surprised how soft they were. I gave one to my kids and they loved them. Definitely getting more for them!
1307,B007JFMH8M,4,Scrumptiously soft delight,"These are great on the go treats for adults, and the kids too - if you wanna share ;)<br />They're bursting with flavor and nutritious to boot."
1308,B007JFMH8M,5,so good,totally my kids favorite cookie so good soft not so much sweet exactly one that i want to give my kid
1309,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies - My New Favorite,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are now my favorite cookies.  They are so soft and delicious.  And I love how they come individually wrapped so I don't have to worry about the rest of them going stale.<br />I definitely recommend giving these cookies a try - you'll be glad you did!
1310,B007JFMH8M,5,So Good!,"I got a sample of these from Influenster, and I went out and bought more right away.  These are the softest and tastiest packaged cookies I've had.  I love the flavor, Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my favorite.  Even though they are cookies, I feel like I could be doing a lot worse health-wise than these."
1311,B007JFMH8M,4,"Just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth,","I received a sample package of this product complimentary from [...]  to try. I must say, it was super yummy. The cookies are large enough to satisfy my sweet tooth yet small enough that i didn't feel like I was gorging myself either. Best part is, they are healthy enough that i don't mind feeding them to my kiddos as a special treat."
1312,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy and good for on the go!,"Love the soft baked cookies, tastes great and I don't feel guilty eating this cookie. They are also individually wrapped so it's great for throwing in a bag for hiking or in kid's lunch. I tried the oatmeal raisin and must say it's my favorite, apparently many others favorites as I can never found them on the shelves."
1313,B007JFMH8M,5,my kids loved them,I got the influenster box and it had several products in it.  My kids loved the quaker soft bake cookie.  would get some if I were you
1314,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum,Cookie was so soft and my son acutally loved it and he really doesnt like a lot of item. I really love this cookie and i did purchase again.
1315,B007JFMH8M,5,fresh baked taste,my kids and i enjoyed the Quaker Soft Baked cookies.  they are great for lunch boxes and for snacks at home or on the go.  i loved the soft baked texture and fresh taste.
1316,B007JFMH8M,5,great tasting cookie,This is a great tasting cookie.  Portion size is close to perfect.  Soft texture with almost homemade flavor.  What a find?!?! I love these cookies!
1317,B007JFMH8M,4,Delicious Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies!,Quaker always surprises me with all their wonderful products which are satisfying for the whole family. I really love these Oatmeal soft baked cookies!! They are made from whole grain quaker oats and have a wonderful flavor! I can't wait to buy more of these and other yummy products!
1318,B007JFMH8M,5,A Delicious Cookie!,"I really enjoyed these cookies. They tasted fresh & homemade and very soft and chewy.....I will purchase again, definitely a favorite!"
1319,B007JFMH8M,5,just like grandmas,"I just love the oatmeal raisein cookie it was super soft and delicious, i was amazed by the amount of raisens in it because there usually isnt enough in other brands. Not only did i love this cookie but my daughter loved it so much i had to go out and buy a box of them. Id def. reccomend these to any cookie lover, im a fan for life."
1320,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Homestyle Taste,"These are so yummy. They taste just like my grandmas homestyle cookies. They are a perfect texture, just enough sweetness, and leave you craving for more! I can't get enough of them. I eat them with a nice glass of cold milk and it's heaven!"
1321,B007JFMH8M,4,Love this,These are really good.  I love raisin cookies and this one did not dissapoint me.  It is soft and they are in individual packs.  I got it free from Influenster to try and liked it.
1322,B007JFMH8M,2,Mealy texture for an oatmeal cookie,These cookies would be better if they were made with rolled oats instead of oat flour. The crumbly and mealy texture does not provide an enjoyable experience.
1323,B007JFMH8M,4,tasty and great price,"This cookie is full of flavor and at a great price.  I got a sample free in the mail, and will be buying more for my son!  We both loved them."
1324,B007JFMH8M,5,Chewy Goodness,This cookie was moist chewy and delicious.  Both my daughter and I thought it was fabulous and I will definitely buy in the future.
1325,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy!,"This is pretty good for a store bought cookie! It was nice and soft, not too sweet. Just right. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars because I like my cookies a little chewy. Overall great cookie! I got one of these cookies as a sample from @influenster."
1326,B007JFMH8M,5,YUM!,This cookie was really good... I liked the single serve packaging and the portability of the product! great for on the go and not loaded with junk!
1327,B007JFMH8M,5,A+ Cookies,I am very impressed with the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They are a healthier cookie and have a great taste. Very soft and melt in your mouth.
1328,B007JFMH8M,3,Love it!,"It's not too sweet so I like that. The kids love it and let's face it, cookies are generally not healthy, so this is ok, not the healthiest, but good!"
1329,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy,"These cookies are delicious, a little messy but have a great taste, my kids also enjoyed them, it is a lunch bag must have."
1330,B007JFMH8M,4,yummmm,These are so soft and really yummy. I like that I can grab a pouch and toss it in my purse for an afternoon snack.
1331,B007JFMH8M,5,"Love this soft, flavorful cookie!","I'm not a lover of oatmeal raisin cookies, but this one surprised me! I loved how soft and flavorful it was. YUM. I highly recommend. I got these as a sample from Influensters!"
1332,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy Store Bought Cookie!,I love these. They taste great and they are easy to throw in your bag and bring a long with you for a snack for yourself or a child. My 3 year old liked the taste as well. I do think they are a bit pricey but they are full of whole grains which is better than normal cookies.
1333,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft and Delicious,"My son and I both LOVED these cookies, very yummy and delicious.  My son ate them so quickly that I hardly got any LOL.  I really like the texture of the cookies, and they are quite filling."
1334,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are yummy,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster, and it was a big hit.  Soft, chewy, and tasty.  Only thing I would change about it is that it doesn't travel very well because it gets too crumbly."
1335,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMM,"The Quaker Oatmeal Raisin cookies could not be more delicious! They have that homemade taste w/out all the mess!! I was surprised at how soft they were and you could really taste cinnamon and other flavors, they did not taste processed.  The most important thing- my kids loved them too!"
1336,B007JFMH8M,4,Healthy Never Tasted so Delicious,"I got to try these through Influenster. Though I'd planned to buy my own, I'm glad I had to do it for the site, because otherwise I wouldn't have tried the Oatmeal Raisin. I'm not a fan of the combo. I don't know why.<br />But, Quaker did a great job. There was the perfect combination of oatmeal to raisin, and I didn't feel like I was tasting cardboard, as I tend to with oatmeal cookies. Instead, it was super moist, and honestly, if it had been hot, I would have assumed it was straight from the oven. Just perfectly done!"
1337,B007JFMH8M,5,yum!,warm these up and they taste like you just pulled them out of the oven ... love love love these. My kids also really really enjoyed these .... my 5 year old thought they were home made !
1338,B007JFMH8M,4,Delicious!,These cookies are not only yummy but they are good for you. My children love them too. Its a great snack for them and I don't feel guilty giving it to them. Try one!!
1339,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker soft baked cookies,"I do not like Oatmeal raisin cookies, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the soft texture and the taste of these cookies. I would recommend these if you love oatmeal raisin cookies."
1340,B007JFMH8M,5,So Yummy!,I was pleasantly surprised with this cookie. It has a great flavor and was nice and moist! My three year old daughter loved it also!
1341,B007JFMH8M,4,Good Yumminess!!!,"This cookie was very good, but a little dry for my taste! I would also prefer it to taste more like a homemade cookie with more raisins."
1342,B007JFMH8M,5,Must Purchase,It's amazing!  Love the taste and texture!! awesome price!! My 3 year old loved it and she is a HARD SELL!!
1343,B007JFMH8M,5,Perfect for kids,Great taste and packaging. Perfect for lunch boxes and take along snacks. We have enjoyed these cookies and look forward to more flavors.
1344,B007JFMH8M,3,Not my mother's oatmeal cookie,"Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."
1345,B007JFMH8M,3,Too much allspice,"These cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and I think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  The cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste."
1346,B007JFMH8M,4,Moist and delish,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was given to me to sample through Influenster Mom Vox box program.  It tasted like it was home baked.  I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my 14 year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too."
1347,B007JFMH8M,5,The Adult Cookie,Quaker Cookies for me is that one in the package is suffice for me with a cup of tea or hot cocoa. Usually I go digging for a few more cookies to conquer my sweet tooth but not this time.
1348,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft cookies!,"This is a really good cookie! DIdnt really think that I would like a cookie from a company known for its oatmeal, but completely surprised!! It was soft and soooo chewy! Really good served warm & with a cold glass of milk!"
1349,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies - SO GOOD!,"I tried this cookie (which came free in my Mom Vox Box 2012) and I fell in love with it! My kids and my husband liked it, too! It is soft and chewy with a delicious home-baked taste. We will definitely include this in our stash of healthy goodies & snacks!"
1350,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,I wasn't sure if I was gonna like these until I received a free sample and fell in love with it. These cookies are so soft and yummy. My 5 year old loved it. Can't get enough of it.
1351,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"I originally purchased these cookies at the store and then being an influenster I received a sample of the Oatmeal Raisin Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. These make a great snack for kids and adults alike. These are great to carry in a diaper bag for that lil pick me up when out and about. They have so many flavors and styles of there new soft baked. They are soft but not crumbly, easy to eat not to chewy, they are filling and satsfying."
1352,B007JFMH8M,3,Great Snack Alternative for Kids and Adults!,"I'm not a fan of oatmeal or raisins (lol) but I wanted to taste the cookie before I gave it to my daughter. So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.<br /><br />**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  But if I had to grade this with the price that Amazon has it for, I would probably give it 1 star!  A 6-pack of these cookies is $2.69 so why is a 12-pack almost $35 on here?! Am I missing something, lol**"
1353,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum,These soft cookies are very tasty and have a great texture. They are just the right size for an afternoon snack.
1354,B007JFMH8M,3,Love Quaker but not the best product,"I have only tried Quaker Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were not my favorite, however Im still in love with their Oatmeal cereals and granola!"
1355,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"Ok so I love oatmeal cookies they are amazing. And this is one that I approve on for its soft gooey and chewy. It is absolutely amazing. I love it, and would recommend it to anyone that loves oatmeal, and the raisins are sweet they do not taste tart and are not overpowering."
1356,B007JFMH8M,3,"Not bad, not great","I love oatmeal raisin cookies, really love them.  So, I am always on the lookout for a good cookie...especially if they are made by someone other than me.  When I got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said ""Why not?""  The cookies come 6 to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy."
1357,B007JFMH8M,4,Great store bought cookie,"I was pleasently surprised about how soft this cookie was.  It had great flavor, I couldnt even tell there were raisins in the cookie, which is great because I dont normally like raisins.  I like that they come individually wrapped so that all the cookies don't dry out when you want to eat one.  Great snack to take on the go!"
1358,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy Cookies,Theses cookies are yummy and soft even with raisins my toddler likes them. My only problem is one cookie had 170 calories and is not remotely filling. It's not the healthiest snack but it sure is tasty!
1359,B007JFMH8M,5,love it,"Love single served cookies and they are a perfect as a pick-me up. I don't cookies in the house, but this one can stay all wrapped and waiting for the perfect moment"
1360,B007JFMH8M,3,"Bland, but great for older adults","QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils)."
1361,B007JFMH8M,4,Surprisingly good cookie!,"I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, ""store bought"" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT ""low calorie"", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly ""good"" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to ""homemade cookies"".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie."
1362,B007JFMH8M,4,"Great ""Soft baked"" texture.","The folks at Quaker really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.<br /><br />I would have liked more raisins, I couldn't hear ""it thru the grapevine"".<br /><br />Good nutrition for a cookie."
1363,B007JFMH8M,4,Pretty durn good cookie.,"Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are ""moist"" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!"
1364,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum!,"The box says, ""soft baked oatmeal cookies"" and that is exactly what you get!  The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for ""on the go"" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!"
1365,B007JFMH8M,5,Strong cinnamon spice,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies."
1366,B007JFMH8M,5,This cookie is a winner,"This oatmeal cookie was delicious - soft, full of raisins and not too sweet or sugary.  Full of whole grain, I feel confident eating this cookie and giving it to my family to eat as well.  Great item to have in the bag for a quick snack that feels like a treat and is filling too!  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster for introducing me to this product!"
1367,B007JFMH8M,4,"Good, Portable Snack","Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!"
1368,B007JFMH8M,5,quaker soft baked cookies,me and my kids loves this.. so soft and healthy and soooo good... easy packed and grab and go... I cant stop one just one... lol
1369,B007JFMH8M,4,Taste Almost Homemade,"These cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  While they are 170 calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  They are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  They are almost as good as mom used to make!"
1370,B007JFMH8M,4,Delicious and satisfying,I sampled this product for the Influenster Mom Vox Box that I received in the mail.  I am purchase Quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the Quaker brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis.
1371,B007JFMH8M,5,"Fresh, Moist and Good",The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins were so moist with a fresh baked taste.  They had just the right amount of raisins to make them taste just like home made cookies.
1372,B007JFMH8M,5,OMG So so good!!,I recieved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal and Raisins Cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012. My husband and kids devoured the cookie before I had a chance to look at it or taste it. So this is what they thought of the cookie. It was sooooo good according to my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. He is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. I gave this product a 5 star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!
1373,B007JFMH8M,5,So  good,"Tried the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They were so good, nice and soft,fresh and just the right amount of raisins. Even my kids liked them. You have no idea what you are missing out on if you don't try them."
1374,B007JFMH8M,4,Healthy Sweet Snack,"I like soft cookies, but most of the ones you buy taste ""fake"".  Really enjoyed the Quaker Soft Baked with Raisins.  I recieved a sample in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and loved it.  I buy them to use as quick snacks, taste sweet and delicious but are healthier than other options."
1375,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"Quaker made with whole grain oats very soft ,healthy &  have rasin naturally flavored ,healthy product. Have iron 8% , fiber 4 Grams also calcium 4%."
1376,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and chewey,This cookie was very moist but it did not crumble when you took it out of the package.  It was full of flavor but it didn't satisfy your snack hunger.  I will definitely be buying more of these
1377,B007JFMH8M,3,Its Ok,They are really soft and somewhat fresh tasting but i thought they had to many raisins.i dont think i would buy again.
1378,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy!!!!,I received a sample (Oatmeal & Raisin) from my Mom VoxBox and love it. Not to sweet and very moist...just right.

They are cookie and not as moist as a bar, but wonderful none the less. They offer the following benefits:<br /><br /> -Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving"
1390,B007JFMH8M,5,Addictive,"They are awesome and addictive with cold milk. Perfect snack on the go. A little expensive for single serving one pack but, worth it:)"
1391,B007JFMH8M,5,kids love it!,My kids absolutely love these cookies and theyre healthy too! and as a mom i dont mind my children eating these!
1392,B007JFMH8M,5,You can actually taste the oatmeal :),As part of Influenster I received a Mom VoxBox full of great products to try and review.  Included was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie.  I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)
1393,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Tasting!,"This is one of the best tasting, soft cookies we had in a very long time!  The kids were fighting over who had the last one!"
1394,B007JFMH8M,5,yummy and delicious,these cookies are very soft and moist.. my kids love them!! my kids cant wait til i buy them again!!

1398,B007JFMH8M,5,tasty and affordable,"this product was affordable, great texture, good nutrition and perfect taste. i will definitely purchase again. i received it through the influenster program and am very grateful to have been introduced to a alternative to my keebler cookies and oreos with a much more beneficial eating experience."
1399,B007JFMH8M,4,yummy,I love these cookies ! My kids love them too I had to fight them just to get a bite.  I would recommend these to anyone
1400,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMMMM,I enjoy the fact that they are so soft and taste homemade.. No after taste like alot of cookies or oatmeal cookies.. And its healthy instead of a lot of sugar and empty cals
1401,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and yummy,"Great when you're in the mood for a good, filling cookie! They are soft and tase great, and they're better than chocolate chip especially for kids."
1402,B007JFMH8M,4,"Soft, Chewy and Delicious!",My family and I tried the Soft Bake Oatmeal Cookies and we loved them. I personally like to put them in the microwave for a couple of seconds to warm them; then it is just like a fresh baked cookie!
1403,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Bakes Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins,I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie and oh em GEE.  This was a cookie that was just as good as the ones my Grandma used to make when I was little.  I shared half with my son and he kept saying MMMMM MMMM mommy MMMMM!  Highly recommend this cookie to anyone!
1404,B007JFMH8M,4,Perfect for Cookie Craving 3yr olds!,"I loved how the cookie was nice and soft when I opened the packaging. It seemed to be made of fresher ingredients. I decided to split the cookie in two and let the kids each have one side. I had to split it because the package only had one cookie in it. My daughter devoured it, my son...he saw there were raisin's in it and freaked out. K ended up eating her brother's half as well. I was bugged for days by her for another cookie so she must have loved it since that's how 3yr olds express love for food! (I WANT MORE COOKIE!)<br />I didn't get a chance to personally try the cookie, but over all it seemed good and from a brand that I like and trust, it also smelled pretty yummy!"
1405,B007JFMH8M,5,omg the best cookie ever,this cookie is amazing i couldnt think of a better snack for my daughter during the day to give her  it healthy and it taste great  and i loved how soft the cookie was
1406,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft and Chewy,These cookies are very soft and chewy! This cookie is perfect for those sweet tooth cravings and its a healthy option.
1407,B007JFMH8M,4,Taste Good,"Received these in my Influenster box for Summer, taste great and very soft. Seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost."
1408,B007JFMH8M,5,Tastes homemade!!!,"These cookies tastes so good. If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave before eating, they taste like they just came out of the oven. Very fresh!"
1409,B007JFMH8M,3,Ok,My family and I tried this cookie and we all had different responses. I thought it was too sweet and did not taste like I home baked cookie. My husband thought it was too dry and crumbly and my son thought it was yummy.... he is 9.
1410,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMMY!!!,I only got to eat one little bite of my sample from Influenster because my son stole it and ate it!  Ha ha but the bite that I did have was amazing.  I will be getting more of these to keep in the house.
1411,B007JFMH8M,5,"Quick, easy and delicious!!","Quaker wins again with these delicious cookies.  I was particularly loving the individually wrapped aspect of the oatmeal raisin cookies.  I hate opening a box and having half of the cookies go stale because the air gets to them.  These are so easy to throw into your bag or just grab one when you want and they are always fresh, soft and yummy."
1412,B007JFMH8M,5,Fantastic snack,"I thoroughly enjoyed trying out the Quaker soft-baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies as part of the Influenster program.  The cookie was moist, soft, chewy... everything an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  The taste was superb - just the right amount of cinnamon & nutmeg - and it was super filling and held me over perfectly until dinner time.  When I tried them out, I was 8 months pregnant and constantly hungry, so for a cookie to be able to hold me over for that long... color me impressed!"
1413,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy Goodness !,"Awesome cookies . Great snack to have in the cupboard when you want something quick and sweet. The quality is amazing , worth every penny and then some."
1414,B007JFMH8M,5,Mommy's Cookies,"I love these cookies, I will have to hide them from the kids because although they would be easy to throw into a lunch box they are nice and healthy for a cheat every now and then."
1415,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum!,I just got done reviewing the quaker soft baked cookie line via @influenster and #momvox! They were absolutely amazing! Soft and moist perfect snack for adults and kids the same.
1416,B007JFMH8M,5,AWESOME,"I HAVE A SON WHO IS VERY PICKY AND HE LOVES SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES. I RECEIVED A FREE COOKIE FROM INFLUENSTER AND HE TOOK IT, I TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS HEALTHY FOR HIM BUT HE WANTED TO EAT IT ANY WAYS AND HE LOVED IT. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT 3 BOXES OF QUAKER COOKIES FOR MY KIDS."
1417,B007JFMH8M,3,Quaker Cookie,It was very tasty and soft. It was a little dry for me but my 7 year old loved it. I have a glass of milk with the cookie and it is a nice treat.
1418,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Batch Cookies are a hit in my book!,I received this product to test courtesy of Influenster and Quaker and I have to say they are a hit in my house. This was the first product we tried out of the 5 we were sent to test and it lasted less then ten minutes in my home. My toddler was anxious to give them a try and I have already purchased two more boxes since we tasted the first one. They will definitely be a staple product. I love that they are from a trusted brand and I love that they are made with whole grains and I can feel good about my snack choice!
1419,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,Delicious and perfect for on the go. Kids love them and they're healthy for them too. I like how they taste home-baked and are soft and chewy. You can even heat them up slighly in the microwave for 5seconds and theyre perfect. I recieved a sample from influenster for free for testing and review purposes. Thank you.
1420,B007JFMH8M,4,Tasty cookie at a fair price,"This cookie package was featured at the local supermarket, so I picked up a pack for a road trip I was going on.  I liked the fact the cookie was soft (probably the reason the cookie was individually wrapped), and the taste was almost as good as homemade.<br /><br />Four solid stars for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie.  Just shop on price; if the price is good, you'll enjoy your treat."
1421,B007JFMH8M,5,Chewey Goodness,This was delicious! Add a glass of milk and you have a kids favorite snack! If you love soft cookies these are perfect for you. Wish more came in a box!

They are a quick and easy snack on the go. They are a bit crumbly, but well worth it to see their smiling faces."
1423,B007JFMH8M,5,Kid approved ;),I have a picky eater and what completely suprised that he actually liked them! They are so soft and not too sweet! They are heavenly! These will make a great lunchbox treat for your little ones! Highly recommend these!

1425,B007JFMH8M,4,Yumm !!,I love these cookies they are soft and good ! They are great for kids to take as a snack with them I love these !! Great !
1426,B007JFMH8M,4,Not Bad,"After trying this cookie I can honestly say it was not all that bad...however, I did notice a vitamin like after taste that at times was a bit over powering. I also didn't like how crumbly it is but your gonna eat it anyway so I can over look that"
1427,B007JFMH8M,5,sooooo delicious,"I was presented to try one from my mom voxbox, one word, heaven... It was the first thing I tested.. my 1yr old son even loves em, I already went thru 3boxes"

1429,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Cookies to go!,I received this from Influenster to test and we loved how deliciously soft it was! My son and I enjoyed devouring it!
1430,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,"I absolutely loved this cookie. I received this as a free sample but I couldn't just have one so I went out on a search for them and found them at my grocery store. I was so happy because that one big cookie was everything I have been looking for, not too sweet, not too bland, not salty, not too many rasins and most of all not many calories. The perfect snack, especially with a cup of tea and a book..."
1431,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,I enjoyed these cookies. They are delicious and not too sweet. The price is very affordable. I received the product to test and went out and bought a box.
1432,B007JFMH8M,5,Great taste and good for you!,This cookie taste wonderful.  What's even better is it is good for you too. It does not taste like you are eating oatmeal.  It is a great treat or meal on the run.
1433,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker Soft Backed Oatmeal Cookie,"My daughter loved my free sample of this cookie from influenster. She goobled it right down, which i didn't think she would. She's not the biggest fan of rasins. I tried a bite and thought it was kinda dry myself but if my daughter loves it, i will buy it again! :)"
1434,B007JFMH8M,5,mmmmm gooood,my children love these cookies and so do I. They are soo moist and delicuos. These by far are the best tasting oatmeal cookies I have EVER had.
1435,B007JFMH8M,5,So yummy!,"Our family is super impressed with these cookies!  They have great flavor, the cinnamon really pops and they stay soft.  They really are about as close to grandma's homemade as I have ever purchased."
1436,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum,This cookie was super soft and yummy. It had great flavor.It's a great snack for anyone in the family! I will be buying more of this.
1437,B007JFMH8M,4,Just Like I Like It,"To me, the perfect oatmeal cookie would be soft and filled with those soul-comforting warm spices that kind of remind you of Christmas and that is exactly what you get with the Quaker Oats Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie.  Perfect for a mid-morning snack with a cup of coffee."
1438,B007JFMH8M,5,Yumm!!!,These cookies are amazing!! Taste like a home baked cookie.  They are soft and chewy just like I love my cookies!  I highly recommend them
1439,B007JFMH8M,3,"Great product, but.....","It's a little too dry for my taste.  However, the price and packaging are amazing.  My kid will love these."
1440,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker Soft Baked,This cookies are delightful. They are easy to grab and throw into the kids lunches or snack bags and they are healthy too. I will definitely be buying these for the school year.
1441,B007JFMH8M,4,So Soft,These cookies are so soft. They taste great. I would buy these for my family if we did not make our own.
1442,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"I enjoyed this cookie.  I did receive it as a sample through Influenster.<br />It was soft and enjoyable to eat.  I really like how they are individually wrapped.<br />Specially since we seem to have a ant problem.  I will buy this product again, specially<br />for my grandkids.."
1443,B007JFMH8M,4,YUMMY,I got a sample of the Raisin Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster in my Vox Box and it was nice and chewy. I love soft cookies and this was great. I will buy a box next time I go to the store!
1444,B007JFMH8M,5,Almost as good as homemade!,"I love the Quaker Soft Baked Raisin Oatmeal Cookies. They are by far my favorite.  When I don't feel like baking, or it's too hot to do so, I grab these.  They live up to their soft baked claims.  They are also even better heated for a few seconds in the microwave.  Definitely almost as good as homemade."
1445,B007JFMH8M,4,"Tastes great, but expensive.","I tried these oatmeal ones and I loved how chewy they were and they weren't bad taste-wise.  I just think that for the price and how few you get in the box, I'd rather make my own.  But if you aren't great at baking, you should definitely buy some!"
1446,B007JFMH8M,5,LOVE,"These were amazing! Out of the oven fresh, and full of flavor! Best store bought cookies I have ever tried."
1447,B007JFMH8M,5,YUM!,"These cookies are fantastic! I usually don't like ""Chewy"" cookies because of their textures but i just LOVED these! They tasted amazing! They tasted as if they were just made! Warm them up for a few seconds in the microwave and bam! Yummy ""fresh baked-like"" Cookies!"
1448,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies,Very soft and chewy. The whole family loved them and I usually don't like raisin cookies but these were very delish!
1449,B007JFMH8M,5,Great for sharing,"Loved them!<br />I opened the box and got the items out and took a picture. My son saw the cookie and got super excited. I opened the cookie and took a bite then set it down to grab a drink. I came back, and it was gone! My 3 year old had destroyed it! lol.<br />We both agreed it was really good and ran out to buy a box of them. We enjoyed them together that night after dinner with some cookies. Yummy!"
1450,B007JFMH8M,4,Simply Delicious,I received one of these Quaker Soft Baked Cookies in my Influenster Mom Voxbox I was hesitant to eat it as it was 170 calories their are lower calorie alternative snacks out there and cookies but this is as close to homemade as you get i liked that its soft baked and breaks apart easily the overall taste was pretty good as well. Not a purchase for me unless they were to cut about 50 calories from it.
1451,B007JFMH8M,4,Loved Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies!,The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies were delicious! They were soft and chewy and full of whole oats. My kids gobbled them up and wanted more. I had one with my chamomile tea and the kids enjoyed theirs with milk. I would definitely recommend these cookies for the whole family.
1452,B007JFMH8M,4,Great for a quick snack,These are pretty tasty and filling. If I have no time to eat these hold me over til the next meal.
1453,B007JFMH8M,5,go and get em!,These cookies are excellent and the kids love them too! I recieved them as a sample and went out and bought a box the same day!
1454,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,"These cookies are great! They are super soft and chewy with a great texture. My kids LOVED them, and they are moderately healthy."
1455,B007JFMH8M,4,Really soft and yummy!,"I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie from Influenster.  I thought it was kinda crumbly, but my daughter and I loved it."
1456,B007JFMH8M,4,yummy,I got these from influenster to try and they are so soft and yummy. Would recommend these to my friends and family.
1457,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,My 4 year old absolutely loves these. They are always soft and taste super fresh and so easy to find at the grocery store.
1458,B007JFMH8M,3,Not tasty,I dont like how it tastes because i don't like oatmeal or raisins but if you like them then i think its good to eat these cookies because they're healthy and you will probably like the taste.
1459,B007JFMH8M,5,yummy cookies!,I would definitely recommend getting these cookies.  They taste awesome. Great snack at home or on the go. Really not pricey. Everyone should try them!
1460,B007JFMH8M,5,Very good!!,These cookies taste so good. They are fresh and moist! I like that they are the perfect size and that they are individually wrapped.
1461,B007JFMH8M,4,Not a cookie lover,Not really a cookie lover and specifically not and oatmeal & raisin fan but it was really tasty and fresh!!  Received this as a sample.
1462,B007JFMH8M,5,So Yummy!,"In our house we LOVE love LOVE cookies! So this cookie was put to the test, and it totally passed with flying colors.  The tase of it was just so delicious and soft. My daughter (5yrs old) loves these too.  So I don't mind giving this to her because it is a healthier cookie."
1463,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy and healthy,"Loved these. Received them in my influenster voxbbox. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Kids love them too. They taste good, they are nice and soft and the packaging leaves them fresh."
1464,B007JFMH8M,4,good cookie,this is a good cookie very soft and moist I wished they made an oatmeal chocolate chip my kids loved them and I would buy again
1465,B007JFMH8M,5,Great & filling,"These are very good, the pack I got was stale, however they still had great flavor to them and are soft & chewy!! They are also a great size and are very filling on their own!! My son has taken them to school for an after school quick bite before sports, and i love to have them at work in case I am starving and know lunch is getting pushed back in the day. They are really great, and if you have tried their oatmeal breakfast bars these are kinda like them, but not as heavy!!"
1466,B007JFMH8M,4,Good cookie with nice cinnamon taste,Quaker always has high quality products. I like these cookies. They have a great texture and great taste. And they are a good size.  Individually wrapped in foil packets for freshness. Good taste with a nice hint of cinnamon. If you like cinnamon you will love these cookies.
1467,B007JFMH8M,5,"Tasty, healthy, individually-wrapped oatmeal cookies","These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).<br /><br />Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Fiber!  4g per cookie.<br />- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.<br />- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None really.<br /><br />Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.<br /><br />Recommended."
1468,B007JFMH8M,2,So so,"I got these in the momvoxbox from influenster.I am a cookie lover,however these were not my favs.My toddler loved them but he will literally eat almost anything sooooo that doesn't say a whole lot."
1469,B007JFMH8M,2,Just not a good cookie,"I am a cookie lover, so I was excited to get to try this product for free through the Amazon Vine program.  Unfortunately, these are just not very good.<br /><br />They are too crumbly, almost powdery, as if maybe they weren't baked enough.  The flavor is okay, but certainly nothing special.  They are soft, but the texture is not pleasant.<br /><br />They remind me of ""Grandma's Cookies"".  Except they are about half as good."
1470,B007JFMH8M,5,Great For When You're On The Go,"These are a very filling and great tasting.  As a quick snack, when you don't have time for a meal, or a super simple quickie breakfast; these are a very good option.  I highly recommend them."
1471,B007JFMH8M,5,Quality Cookie,"My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies."
1472,B007JFMH8M,3,"Tasty, but not moist enough","These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something."
1473,B007JFMH8M,3,"Just ok, dry and crumbly","They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie."
1474,B007JFMH8M,3,Soft but dry,"One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these."
1475,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,This is a great product. Moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go. This is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day.
1476,B007JFMH8M,3,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie,"Tasty cookie!  It was soft, though maybe just a little dry.  The raisins were actually nice and juicy, not all dried up like in most packaged cookies.  Pretty good overall."
1477,B007JFMH8M,4,Pretty good,This cookie is big enough to share! I love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you!
1478,B007JFMH8M,5,Fresh Out The Oven Taste,"I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The Quaker Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.  This will be the ONLY type of soft cookie I will buy from here on out!  I love the quality of Quaker products!"
1479,B007JFMH8M,5,quaker soft bake oatmeal cookies,These cookies are so good and soft as promised!  Def recommend them to anyone and everyone that is looking for a good cookie at a good price!
1480,B007JFMH8M,5,Big Fan of Oatmeal Cookies,I love Oatmeal Cookies so I was really looking forward to trying these.  They are so good and soft my favorite combo with a oatmeal cookie.
1481,B007JFMH8M,5,great cookie,quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies are so good they are soft which is a plus and the taste is great
1482,B007JFMH8M,5,Amazing!,"I tried these when given to me to review. I will (and have) get more of these! Delicious! I love the chocolate more than the raisin, but that is purely personal preference on my part."
1483,B007JFMH8M,4,Moist and yummy!,"Mommy and kid approved!  I had the opportunity to taste and test Quaker Oatmeal Cookies in Raisin from Influenster and I was happily surprised by the texture, taste, and yumminess.  The kids loved them and didn't even notice the raisins.  I would recommend them for a great healthier snack!"
1484,B007JFMH8M,5,yummy,"The cookie is very soft, chewy, tastes great and good for you. Provides a good sourse of fiber. You fins almost at any store."
1485,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy!!!,These are so yummy and I love to eat them! You have to try them they are sooooo yummy! Very great product and worth the money!
1486,B007JFMH8M,5,Soo good!!,"After trying these for a review for Influenster, I ended up buying a box of these because they were so good! They are soft and they come in individual packages so you can just take on the go. My kids loved these too and since they are a lot healthier then other cookies, I will definitely be purchasing more."
1487,B007JFMH8M,5,Scrumptious Cookies!!!,"I got this is my Mom Vox Box from Influensters to try and my little daughter ate it right up! She thought she wouldn't like it because of the rasins but, she loved it!!! She said it was very soft and yummy! She said it reminds her of grandmas cookies! It tasted like homemade cookies she said! She loved them so much she asked to buy her more every time we go to the store!!! I was very impressed!"
1488,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft & Delicious,"I will absolutely purchase this item.  I received one of these in my Voxbox, and liked it right away.  The flavor is delicious, and it has a chewy, soft consistency (which I prefer in cookies)."
1489,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,I received this product to test as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.com. As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!
1490,B007JFMH8M,5,my favorites,i receive this at a mom voxbox influenster.com i love this cookie its sooo yummii i will buy more of this cookies
1491,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy Goodness,"I received this product to test as a part of Influenster.com. I really don't like oatmeal cookies, but this was definitely a mind changer. It was so soft. It was mouth watering when I smelled it. I smell all fods before I eat them, especially if I am unfamiliar with them,don't ask why, because I don't know lol. But these were great and it was gone before I finished looking through the box. These are definitel great for healthy snacking and I know kids love them dearly. I can't wait to try the other cookie flavors! Thanks Quaker"
1492,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft but a little crumbly,"I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from influenster.com. It was delicious. My only complaint is that is was a little crumbly, a little too messy for kids. Perfect for me however and I was not sharing so it was fine :-)"
1493,B007JFMH8M,4,Good,I like the taste and the texture...i personally dont really like this flavor but its actually pretty good :) it passes my picky taste.
1494,B007JFMH8M,5,In love with aker cookies,"The first thing I noticed when unwrapping my Quaker cookie was the smell. I smelled fresh baked good as soon as I unwrapped my cookie. I received the oatmeal raisin cookie, I'm not a fan of raisins but I was willing to give the cookie a try just based on the amazing smell. When I took my first bite I was in love, the cookie was soft and moist and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. I totally recommend people try this amazing cookie for themselves."
1495,B007JFMH8M,5,A bite of heaven,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from influenster.com. I am not usually a cookie person unless i am baking them myself, but in this case i really enjoyed this cookie. I was even more surprised by the nutrition facts, a cookie good this good should not be good for you. I will definitely be picking up a box on my next shopping trip."
1496,B007JFMH8M,5,Great snack for anytime of the day!!,I have been buying these cookies since they first came out and my family loves them. I have bought every flavor they had and there wasn't one that they didn't like. I will continue to buy these for my family. Great price and delicious!!
1497,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and yummy,I really enjoyed these cookies. They were soft and yummy. Almost like hommade. I would repurchase them again. Quaker is a brand I love and trust for quality.
1498,B007JFMH8M,5,Love them!,I love them they are so chewy and they taste awesome I would definitively make them my favorite. If you are a fan of cookies you will love this ones.
1499,B007JFMH8M,5,These are great!,"I really like these cookies, they are soft and chewy and have the great taste of quaker oats....I will definately be buying these again."
1500,B007JFMH8M,3,Good,"I really liked the Quacker cookies. They were soft and tasted good. I dont think they tasted better than the chocolate chip kind but, they were still good."
1501,B007JFMH8M,5,"Soft, Chewy, and Delicious","I absolutely loved these!  They are soft, chewy, and irresistible.  They are not quite like homemade, but darn close.  I had a hard time eating the sample that I got from Influenster.com.  Both of my children asked for one bite and then were begging for more."
1502,B007JFMH8M,4,Next best to fresh homemade!,I received one of these cookies from Influenster and I am always reluctant to try pre-made cookies because they make my teeth hurt. I was pleasantly surprised when my teeth didn't hurt and the cookie made me think of cookies from my childhood. The cookie was fresh and was soft and I am not a huge fan of raisins but honestly I enjoyed them in this cookie. I will be buying a box of these as they are a great snack item for the kids.
1503,B007JFMH8M,3,Won't replace homemade,"The kids LOVED this, but I mean, hey it's a large, soft, chewy cookie, of course they are going to love this. Hubby is a little more accustomed to my homemade cooking so he could take it or leave it. I thought there could be a few more raisins in it.<br /><br />Thank you influenster for allowing me to try this product."
1504,B007JFMH8M,5,Love these cookies,Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite cookies. These are very soft and the raisin are moist. Will definately be buying more
1505,B007JFMH8M,5,Love this cookie,"I loved these oatmeal raisin cookies. They were huge and full of flavor. if you love oatmeal raisin, you will LOVE these!!"
1506,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,These are great! My kiddos loved  them. Thanks influenster and quacker.<br />I received a sample and the kiddos ate them up.
1507,B007JFMH8M,3,Not Bad for a Packaged Cookie,"These aren't bad for a packaged, commercial cookie. They don't taste fake, they aren't overly sweet, and they have a nice texture. My kids really liked them."
1508,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"These are so soft and delicious. They are from Quaker, so you know that they are good for you! My son and I both loved them."
1509,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft cookie quaker,I absolutely loved this cookie! They are so delicious! i will continue to buy them. They are oist chewy and i could eat a whole box!
1510,B007JFMH8M,5,Thinking differently about oatmeal,I never really liked oatmeal cookies but the commercial for the Quaker soft baked Oatmeal cookie bought me. I loved how soft it was and tasted just as fresh as a cookie that just cooled down out of the oven. I am addicted
1511,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,"My son doesn't usually enjoy cookies unless they are chocolate chip, or have frosting on them, but when I gave my 2 yr old the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie, he ate it right up! they were delicious!"
1512,B007JFMH8M,5,I love this cookie,I am a big fan of oatmeal cookies and no one does it better than Quaker..I however was surprised at how soft this cookies are...I was expecting to need to wrap it and put it in the microwave but it was perfect right out of the package.
1513,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummmm!,"These cookies are delicious, and soft. and still taste as new out the package. I would definitely encourage everyone to get these. I guarantee you and your children will enjoy them :-)"
1514,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"Soft, and oh, so delicious! I'd about had it with packaged cookies until I tried these! You won't be disappointed!!"
1515,B007JFMH8M,5,delicious treat to eat,"I love oatmeal raisen cookies so when i heard that Quaker was selling a new soft baked cookie i was ready to try it. I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't live up to my expectations ,but Im glad i was wrong. It's so soft and yummy . it literally could have been a homemade cookie. its a great treat and i will definitely be buying more."
1516,B007JFMH8M,5,yummy snacks,these soft cookies were vert good. I tryed the Oatmeal rasin soft cookies. They were good. I like oatmeal raisn cookies. I can't wait to try some other the other flavors. These cookies are an A++++ in my house hold. everyone loves them.

1521,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,"I recieved these in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster, all I can say is amazing. My son even likes them!"
1522,B007JFMH8M,5,Awesome Goodness!,"I recently got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies via Influenster in my Mom VocBox and that cookie didn't last 2 minutes in my home!  Once it came out of the box, it was out of the wrapper and I had to split it 3 ways cause the kids saw it and had to have some.  Love the soft, chewy goodness and the flavor is so great and pure.  We are headed out to get some more!<br />*I recieved this product compliments of Influenster however all opinions are my own."
1523,B007JFMH8M,5,delish,"I GOT TO TRY THIS QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE THROUGH THE GOOD FOLKS FROM INFLUENSTER AFTER RECEIVING THEIR 2012 MOMVOX BOX, AND I MUST SAY I LOVE IT, FIRST OF ALL OATMEAL COOKIES ARE MY FAVORITE, SO THERE WASNT ANY DISAPPOINTMENT THERE, THE COOKIE RETAIN ITS SOFTNESS/FRESHNESS OFTER BEING OPENED BY ME FOR A WEEK NOW, AND THAT WAS GOOD, PLUS IT TASTE GREAT SO THUMBS UP"
1524,B007JFMH8M,5,Just Like Mama Used to Make!,"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Quaker and Influenster. I didn't hardly get it out of the box before my 2 year old spied it and had to try it! We split the tasty cookie and both really enjoyed it. I have since bought some of the crunchy Quaker cookies which are really good too, but I really do like the soft, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies for my daughters. It's great afternoon snack and easy to pack in my purse for trips to the zoo or swimming. Also, since there Quaker cookies it's a brand I trust and have used for years so that makes me feel happy about the choice I'm making for my children."
1525,B007JFMH8M,5,Love these!!,I love oatmeal and i love raisins. So the two combined was great!! I loved the Quaker oatmeal and raisin  soft cookie!! I have and will be a future repurchase for myself and my family.
1526,B007JFMH8M,5,Absolutely delicious!!,"As soon as I opened my Mom Vox Box, I pulled out this cookie. I LOVE oatmeal raisin and so does my 2 year old daughter, Lily. She started screaming, ""cookie, cookie mama, cookie"". So naturally I gave in. She liked it. She decided to eat it over her mac and cheese which is unusual for her!

1543,B007JFMH8M,5,Super Yummy!,"I try to restrict the amount of sweets my family has, especially now that I am on a diet. I LOVED these cookies though! They come individually wrapped, which is great for on the go or for little ones. This also makes it easy for me to have just one at a time. They are SUPER YUMMY and  I can't wait to purchase more!"
1544,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummmm,At first I wasn't very excited to try the cookie just because I don't normally eat sweets but these were so good! I got the oatmeal one and I loved it. I wanted another when I was fished!

1547,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy & soft,"My 5 yr old son loved the cookies. I enjoyed it as well, I am just used to cookies being a bit sweeter."

Definitely a good buy."
1551,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"I am in love with these cookies.

I definitely would reccomend them to anyone who likes oatmeal cookies or to anyone wanting to try something new."
1552,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum-O,"I don't normally like oatmeal cookies, but these cookies are so soft, moist, and melt-in-your mouth delicious that I fell in love. I think it's absolutely brilliant that Quaker Oats has started making oatmeal cookies! They are the experts on oatmeal! I can't wait to see what new flavors they come up with next. So far I've had the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana and they were both very good. I also love the convenient single serve packaging, which is great for my daughter's school lunches."
1553,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Taste!,These cookies are very tasty and soft! I received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more!

1559,B007JFMH8M,3,Smells amazing!,"When I first opened the package, I felt like a little kid again!  The cookie smelled just like the creamy oatmeal cookies my mom used to make when I was little!  I did not used to get heartburn as a little kid, though, and there was the drawback!  My tummy is just too tender for those crazy oats!"
1560,B007JFMH8M,2,"Ok, but not like homemade",I'm glad I got to try this before I actually purchased it.  I would not purchase these.  The initial flavor was ok then it left a kind of chemically after taste.  It kind of reminded me of eating a cookie with the texture of a biscuit.  I definitely needed something to wash it down.
1561,B007JFMH8M,5,OATMAZING!,"The Quaker Oatmeal cookies were absolutely delicious; soft, sweet, and perfect in every way! I will definitely be buying these often! They are very flavorful and just melt in your mouth!"
1562,B007JFMH8M,5,So Soft and Delicious!,"I am the type of person who would rather bake something myself because I am so picky about taste and texture.  Let me just say that Quaker NAILED this cookie!  It's awesome!  Somehow it stayed soft and moist, and tasted like it was baked that morning.  Thanks for a quick, easy and healthy snack Quaker!"
1563,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"These cookies are so great! They are soft and chewy and taste delicious. I really love homemade cookies right out of the oven, but these taste just as good! Quaker sure makes a great cookie!"
1564,B007JFMH8M,3,Great Store Bought Cookies,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster to try out and ended up really liking them. I shared the original cookie with my 3yo daughter and husband both of whom enjoyed it also. I actually ended up buying a box the next time we went grocery shopping.<br />The flavor of these is quite nice and the cookies are large and soft. I was impressed with the fact that they're moderately healthy and liked that they weren't too sweet.<br />The cookies are a bit expensive, and I'd prefer to make my own to have more control over the ingredients, but they are a good shopping choice. They're great for short trips or an emergency snack. I'd definitely buy more of them, but not on a weekly basis."
1565,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft baked cookies....YES PLEASE!,"Delicious, fresh-baked cookies without the hassle or trouble of making them!  can't wait to  taste more of their different flavors, so yum!"

1568,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft & yummy,I received one from Influenster and love these cookies because it's soft and chewy without being too sweet. I just wish these were more readily available.
1569,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Oatmeal raisin Cookie I ' U,I received this Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie in my MOMVOXBOX from Influenster and when i tell you this cookie was soft and chewy and so delicious i dont even like oatmeal raisin cookies so i was very hesitant at first to try it. But after i took that first bite i was in love and i instantly went to the nearest walmart and bought a box of quakeroatmeal raisins cookies. This is a product that is worth a try and you also try the other flavors too and hey i even warm my cookies for a couple seconds in the microwave to get the fresh out the oven warmth going on but like i said try it. This cookie is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1570,B007JFMH8M,4,"Super Soft, Mega Delicious!","I was recently given a package of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I'm already a huge fan of almost all Quaker products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol). They were good sized cookies, individually wrapped to ensure freshness, and had a delicious taste. Now I'm craving them! Overall, they were a great cookie! I'd definitely purchase them again. Can't wait til they're back in stock on Amazon!"
1571,B007JFMH8M,4,Will buy more,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies taste closest to homebaked cookies than any others I have tried. My kids loved them, too. They are moist and flavorful. We like them as a snack, or even as a breakfast on the go!"
1572,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"Very very tasty! I received a sample cookie through influenster! This cookie was an amazing guilt free treat! Moist and full of flavor. I had an oatmeal raisin, but there are other flavors. Definitly worth buying. Much healthier than other cookies!"
1573,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,This was a great cookie.  I was very happy with how soft it was.  Being in the individual wrapping made it easy to through in the diaper bag or purse.  My 18 month old son loved the cookie.  Would love to have these in the house at all times.  Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies.
1574,B007JFMH8M,5,love love these,i love this cookies so does my family bought more this week when we went to the store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack
1575,B007JFMH8M,4,Guilty pleasure or guiltless treat?,"Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says ""soft-baked,"" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 6g (9%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 3.5g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg (5%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)<br />Sugars: 12g<br />Other Carbohydrate: 11g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass."
1576,B007JFMH8M,5,Great to take to the office or for kids to take to school!,"My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with."
1577,B007JFMH8M,5,Awesome Product,"This is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. My youngest child is 6 and isn't much of a sweets eater. However, he found the sample I received from Influenster and he LOVED it! I have to say, I was a tad disappointed that he didn't save me any but he assured me it was ""yummy"" Will definitely keep these on stock."
1578,B007JFMH8M,5,Very soft and yummy,These cookies are great! They are very soft and have a great flavor. Perfect for taking on the go for the kids.
1579,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Delicious...Can't Get Enough!,I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. Let me just say that it was so yummy and delicious! After sharing it with my kiddos I was left wanting more. I will definitely be keeping these cookies on hand...the whole family loves them!
1580,B007JFMH8M,5,So yummy!!,"My kids and I absolutely love these cookies, already on our 2nd box!! I am excited to try all the different flavors, good cookies and they are so tasty!! Yum"
1581,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicioso,My daughter and I absolutely love theses oatmeal cookies. Has the right amount of sweetness. Very soft not crunchy like most cookies. Taste like what grandma would bake at home.
1582,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,"I received the Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie as part of my Mom voxbox from Influenster.com. It was the first thing I took out of the box because I was hungry. I was honestly expecting not to like it. When I first opened the bag it smelled very fresh. I took a bite of it and instantly loved it. I loved how fresh, soft and chewy the cookie was. I went out and bought more so my husband can also have some, he also loved them. They are a great on the go snack."
1583,B007JFMH8M,5,Good cookies.,"Good oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />You can pretend you're eating something healthy.  When your marathoner, vegan, 4% body-fat co-worker says, ""Cookies?"" in their smug, disdainful fashion, you can reply, ""No, it's oatmeal"".  Then cram another seven in your mouth, 'cause these are *really* good cookies.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court"
1584,B007JFMH8M,4,VERY TASTY!!,"I love oatmeal cookies!So I decided to try these out.Well I'm a really big fan of these cookies. Their good, tasty, and it's easy to eat when your busy in the morning or you just need a quick snack. You can even heat these up a bit in the microwave or have them cold, it's great either way. But the one complaint I have of these are the raisins, I don't know they just didn't taste that great and they kept getting stuck everywhere my mouth.Glad I tried them though!!"
1585,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,These Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious! They are SUPER soft and taste absolutely wonderful. They are made with whole grain which is always a plus and are naturally flavored. My daughter loved them too. We will probably be getting more next time we go grocery shopping!
1586,B007JFMH8M,3,quaker brand challenge,Quick Take:<br />it was a C+<br /><br />Usage Tips:<br />good for kids if they come pre-packaged. kids liked it.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Didn't quite taste home made. too much molasses? too many carbs.<br /><br />love the commercial of the woman biting the neighbors cookie.
1587,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies,I got a sample on the Oat Meal Raisin from Influenster.  My kids really loved the taste and we have since bought more.  I think these are great and better than having candy or something else less healthy.
1588,B007JFMH8M,5,so good !,"I Love these cookies , i have had the oatmeal raisin and the chocolate chip ones and cant wait to try them all mmmmmmmmm good !!"
1589,B007JFMH8M,3,Were ok...,These cookies were okay. My 2 & 6 year old sisters loved them but I don't think I'd buy them for myself.
1590,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,Def love these cookies! I let my kids eat it. I don't feel guilty afterwards! Pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to make them extra soft :)
1591,B007JFMH8M,5,Loved it!,"I received one of these in my VoxBox to try, it did not make it into the house! It was delicious! Very soft and chewy, flavorful, full of raisins! Absolutely loved it! I can't wait to go shopping so I can get a whole box of these!"
1592,B007JFMH8M,5,Great on the go snack for the kids!,These cookies were delicious! I love that they were individually packed so I could throw a couple in the diaper bag without having to fuss with pre packing snacks in sandwich bags.  The cookies stayed moist and yummy until snack time.  My kid loves it and so do I.
1593,B007JFMH8M,5,super yummy!!,"these cookies are super yummy! I love how they can be a quick, tasty and healthier on the go breakfast option.My whole family loves them!"
1594,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,I tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie's as a sample through Influenster.  They were so soft and tasted just like homemade.  It is exactly what I expected from Quaker!
1595,B007JFMH8M,4,Treat your Whole Grains,"Three years ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It sucked. There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. With a variety of flavors there's sure to be one for most soft baked style cookie lovers."
1596,B007JFMH8M,5,Love these!,"I received a Soft Baked oatmeal cookie in my VoxBox and was very excited to try it. I am always skeptical about the cookies that are advertised as ""soft"". This one truly is. I tried to save some for my husband but it didn't sit there for long. I wish my oatmeal cookies turned out like this!"
1597,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!!!,"I absolutely love these cookies! They taste just like homemade Oatmeal Raisin cookies that Grandma would make! They are a good sized cookie too, not the teeny tiny ones like most companies make!"
1598,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY!,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are so good! They taste like a homemade cookie! If you want that right out of the oven taste try heating up the cookie for about ten seconds. It will be warm and soft!
1599,B007JFMH8M,5,Lovely Cookie,"I received a free Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit for me. I love this cookie (but of course I share a little piece with with my husband). I could not put the cookie down, it was so good that I went out and bought a box of the almond with chocolate chips. Can't wait to go and buy more."
1600,B007JFMH8M,4,Delish,"I saw these when they first came out so I decided to buy a box. Unfortunately I didn't realize they also make a crunchy version and I grabbed that box by accident. While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon."
1601,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Cookes are a Hit,From bbwife31: I received a free Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit in our house. My son devoured almost the whole thing in 2 minutes. The few bites that I got to eat were super delicious and I am not even an oatmeal raisin kind of gal. It was very moist and flavorful. Will buy again in the future!!
1602,B007JFMH8M,4,Great Snack,"My son really enjoyed the cookie. He is not a big raisin fan, but the soft oatmeal he liked. I think there was a good amount of raisins in it for the average cookie. I love the single packaging, makes it easy to take a snack on the go."
1603,B007JFMH8M,5,delicious,"A delicious little snack, can also substitute for breakfast in a hurry! The kids weren't so thrilled but what mom doesn't love a snack that's safe in the pantry?!?!"
1604,B007JFMH8M,5,Yes Please!,These cookies are soft and delicious. I am very picky about my oatmeal raisin and Quaker delivered! No Trans Fat is a BIG PLUS!

1612,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,I love oatmeal cookies but not from a package.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are and actually taste home baked!  Good job Quaker!
1613,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft and Chewy,"This cookie was absolutely delicious. I received it free in my influenster Mom Voxbox. I only had 1 bite since I shared it with my boys but it that one bite was good enough to tell me it was delicious. It was soft, chewy, satisfying. My kids loved it and wanted more. We have even went and bought some more when we went grocery shopping."
1614,B007JFMH8M,4,Great for me and the little one!,I loved the chewyness of the cookie. I was initially worried that it would be cloyingly sweet but the oatmeal gave it a lovely texture without adding too much unnecessary sugar. Will definitely purchase this product. Thanks to Influenster I got to try this product for free!
1615,B007JFMH8M,5,Great!!,"Very soft chewy, and yummy! Heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it tastes even better! Definitely worth trying not hard ,not to chewy and not to sweet just right. Kids love them 2 :)"
1616,B007JFMH8M,3,Great chewy cookie,"The cookie minus the raisins, which I don't care for, were great. Its rather tasty to have such a high nutritional value. I am interested in trying other flavors."
1617,B007JFMH8M,5,My daughter ate my cookie!!!!,"I got a free cookie, from Influenster.com a few weeks ago, and it didn't make it for much longer than 5 minutes.<br /><br />I opened my box, I got my stuff out, I went to get my camera so I could make an ""unpacking"" video, and when I got back, the cookie was gone, and there was a really guilty looking 5 yr old sitting beside the empty wrapper.<br /><br />So I never got to try it. :( But judging from the satisfied look on my daughter's face, she LOVED it!"
1618,B007JFMH8M,4,quick on the go light breakfast,These cookies are great for in the morning when you are in a rush and don't have time to make breakfast they are so tasty! They are even better warmed up. These are also great to keep around for the kids for snack time or to put in there lunch box for school.
1619,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummmm,"Very soft chewy, and yummy! Heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it tastes even better! Definitely worth trying and buyin!"
1620,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"Delicious. Soft, ""almost"" falls apart soft. Great cinnamon flavor. I allowed myself to only eat half of it at a time so I could savor it."
1621,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMMYY,"These Cookies are delicious! My kid absolutely loved them. I love that they are individually packed, it makes such an easy grab and go snack ! great product."
1622,B007JFMH8M,4,"Chewy, delicious cookie!!","Mmm! I think that about sums it up. I love how soft these are. I couldn't stop eating them and I'm ashamed to say that I want to buy more. Bye-bye, diet. :("
1623,B007JFMH8M,5,awesome cookie,this cookie tastes soo good im really not a fan of raisins but when i tasted this cookie it was like another thing i really recommend it its so good and delicious
1624,B007JFMH8M,4,Whole Grain Treat,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test from Influenster via the Mom VoxBox. My 3 year old son loved the cookie - each cookie is pretty large, very soft and full of raisins. If you buy a package of 6, they are individually wrapped which is great for travel. It is great that they are made with whole grain Quaker oats - and that they have a nice helping of raisins. They are still a cookie though and have 12 grams of sugar per cookie. I did buy a box for my son for an occasional treat."
1625,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"I recieved one of these to try out in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. I am not a huge raisin fan but I really enjoyed this cookie. So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again. The cookie was super soft, great for my 1 year old to eat. It was also big enough that I could split it between both kids. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a delicious cookie."
1626,B007JFMH8M,4,Great snack for kids,These were surprisingly tasty. My kids loved them too and they are a great on the go snack. They offer a quick pick me up and aren't too messy in the car when on the go.
1627,B007JFMH8M,4,Sooo yummy!,I got a free bar in my voxbox from influenster and wow!! Soo yummy!! It melts in your mouth and even my 2 year old loved it!
1628,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum :),"Was fortunate enough to receive this in my mommy Voxbox :) I've tried these delicious cookies before, but it was the first time I had shared one with my son. Needless to say, he loved it. I believe it was good because it somewhat melts in your mouth & is really easy to chew (he's 2) .. I will definitely be repurchasing these for us!!"
1629,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,I was able to try this yummy cookie when it came in my momvox and i have to say i don't like raisins but when i took my first bite i was very amazed at how good it tasted i would defiantly buy theses for myself as well as my family
1630,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Tasting,"I got this cookie as a part of my Mom Box from VoxBox. I'm not too keen on oatmeal cookies, but this one was surprisingly good. I guess I'm more used to them being hard so I really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie. Now a chocolate chip one would be fab!"
1631,B007JFMH8M,4,So soft and chewy...yummy,"These are amazing, soft, and fresh! They taste great and I bought more after I got a free sample from my Mom Vox Box from Influenster~~~ so yummy."
1632,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and Nummy,"Great brand provides a great cookie.  They are soft and have lots of flavor, definitely worth your money.  I received a sample of this from Influenster and am not a fan of raisins, but I agreed to try and review so I gave it a whirl.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  I can't wait to try other kinds!<br /><br />[...]"
1633,B007JFMH8M,5,cookie heaven,I love love love these yummy snacks. Great for an on the go morning. and the kids love them too!
1634,B007JFMH8M,5,YUM YUM!!,This cookie is so good.  It tasted great.  I ate it faster then I could get it out the box.  I am definately buying more soon!
1635,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMMY,"These are amazing, soft, and fresh! They taste great and I bought more after I got a free sample from my Mom Vox Box from Influenster~~~ so yummy."
1636,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"This cookies are amazingly good. I got a free sample in my Mom Vox Box from Influenster and am glad I got to try them out. I'm usually not a fan of oatmeal cookies but these were so soft and moist and had me wanting more. Not only are they good but they're good for you, they're low in fat and high in fiber so they make for a good afternoon snack or evening dessert. I can't wait to go buy more at the store!"
1637,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy!,"I can't wait to pick up some more of these! I love soft, chewy cookies and these definitely hit the spot."
1638,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Quaker Oats Soft Baked Cookie,"I love this product, it was delicious and my daughter enjoyed it as well, i cant wait to get my hands on more !"
1639,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies,"Quaker is a trusted brand that has always had great products and this in no different. The cookies are soft , chewy and very fresh. I love that the cookies are individually wrapped for easy snacks or lunches. Its a treat that I feel good giving my family. Will be buying in the future!"
1640,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and Delish!,"I received this cookie in my mom voxbox. This cookie was soft and delicious! My kids usually only eat cookies with chocolate chips or M&M's in them, but surprisingly enough, they snatched it from my hands and gobbled it up! I love that it is only 170 calories per cookie, 4 grams of fiber, and 8% iron, making it a good snack. I only wish it had less sugar."
1641,B007JFMH8M,5,"The softest, yummiest cookie ever!","I tried the best cookie ever from Quakers! I never tasted a soft, fresh cookie like Quakers Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. I was one of the lucky ones to receive a Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012 (complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster). The Voxbox comes with several items and one of the items was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie. It tasted like a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie. The raisins, the oats and you could even taste the cinnamon that's in the cookie. It was so delicious, even my kids loved it! I have 4 kids: 2 year old, 3 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and they all enjoyed a piece of the cookie. The little ones even started crying when it was all done. So that definitely means I have to go out and buy some more."
1642,B007JFMH8M,5,"Great cookie, and good for you","This is going to be the fastest review you have ever read because this is a great cookie.<br /><br />Thoughts: This is a really ez and fast way for you and your kids to snack on the go, a great way to get your fiber, and its for you.<br /><br /> The Run Down: If you are a fan of oatmeal cookies then you'll love these. They are soft and chewy like the name says.<br /><br />The Final Say: I have bought them for my family and my little one loves them. We talk them every where. They are about 3$ for a box of 6. All in all i give these 5 (*****). Ill keep buying them for the family. So go get some for yourself!!"
1643,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!!!,These cookies are moist just like homemade cookies!!! By far the best store bought cookie and is a must have in any moms pantry!!
1644,B007JFMH8M,3,Oatmeal Raisin,I received the oatmeal raisin cookie in my momvoxbox from influenster and it was pleasantly surprised by how chewy and tasty the cookie was considering that oatmeal raisin cookies are usually hard.  I'm not a big fan of the oatmeal raisin cookies but my little brother loved it and i'll most likely purchase the chocolate chip cookies because their a healthier alternative to most i think :)
1645,B007JFMH8M,5,Great taste & Good for toddlers,"I love oatmeal cookies, but sometimes they tend to be too hard or too dry! Not these!! These are soft and great to give to my toddler when he wants something sweet. I don't like to give him snacks with too much sugar and these are perfect."
1646,B007JFMH8M,5,Healthy & Delish,"This is not at all what I was expecting, but better! The cookie was so moist and just delicious! Im not a huge fan of raisins, but in all honestly you could not even tell the cookie had raisins, you couldnt even taste them. Absolutley worth the buy, will be purchasing in the future!!"
1647,B007JFMH8M,4,Chewy Delight!!,I Tried this product in my mom vox box and it was delicious and soft. My i pinched my children a piece off and they loved it too! We will be buying these more often.
1648,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Taste,"These cookies are Quaker baked, mom and kid approved. They are soft, chewy, and most of all delicious. The texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking."
1649,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy & Good for you.,Great taste and healthy what more could you ask for. Most cookies of this type are dry and make you think you are eating paper but not with Quaker they are soft and moist!
1650,B007JFMH8M,5,SOOOOO GOOD,These are so good and soft and chewy! The taste is delicious. I tried the Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were delicious. Definitely recommend!
1651,B007JFMH8M,4,I got a free sample to try and will be buying in the future,"This cookie was actually really yummy.  I'm not usually the type of person to like raisins in my cookies, but these were really good and moist. I will definitely be buying these in the future. :)"
1652,B007JFMH8M,4,Loved it - except for the Raisins,I got to sample this for free. These were soft and delicious. I actually left this partially eaten on the counter overnight and it was still soft the next day when I finished it. Which is good because my kids only half finish what they start eating. I thought it was a great tasting oatmeal cookie - just better without the raisins. I'm not big on them but I was able to pick them out. They need these just in oatmeal with no other ingredient - like raisins added.
1653,B007JFMH8M,5,Y.U.M.,"I received this item in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie was very soft and flavorful. Usually you get cookies like this and they are either hard or dry, and that was not the case with Quaker Brand. I'm not a big fan of raisins but they were fine in this cookie. Just the right amount and not over powering.<br /><br />This is one cookie I would purchase on my own, and I'm sure my son will be very happy about it."
1654,B007JFMH8M,5,Delightful surprise,"I received this item for free from Influenster in my mom Vox Box. I am not usually a fan of raisins, but this cookie was soft and tasted just like it was freshly baked. I absolutely loved it."
1655,B007JFMH8M,5,amazing,These cookies are so yummy..<br />They are so soft & don't get stale. I would definitely repurchase these.. I want to try other flavors!
1656,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum! Love these cookies,I received a sample of your soft baked oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.  Within seconds of opening the box my kids were fighting over who would get it!  We all got a taste and it was delicious!  I really liked the flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely buy your product again in my local grocery or on amazon.
1657,B007JFMH8M,5,Chewy and Delicious,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br />As soon as I opened up the box, the cookie was on top. My 5 year old couldn't wait to get her hands on it.<br />She enjoyed every single morsel. And wanted more. So on my next food shopping day, I will definitely be picking up a box. GREAT JOB QUAKER!"
1658,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft and incredible,"I received the Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box and I saw the cookie sitting right on top, so of course I opened it and tried it out! This cookie was so soft and chewy that I am totally buying more as snacks for my little cookie monster!"
1659,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br /><br />I opened the box, saw the cookie and ate it right away. I was going to save half for my nephew to try but it was so good I ended up eating both halves any way. Nice and soft and chewy and sooooo yummy. TOTALLY buying more"
1660,B007JFMH8M,4,GREAT COOKIE,This cookie barely last five minutes in my hands. It was soft & chewy and great on-the-go snack. Its perfect for kids and adults.
1661,B007JFMH8M,5,Incredibly delicious oatmeal cookie!,"I had the opportunity to try a Quaker Soft Baked  Oatmeal Cookie through Mom VoxBox, and whew was I pleased! I took my sample into work and had it for a snack one night. Soft and with just the right amount of cinnamon in their oatmeal cookie!"
1662,B007JFMH8M,5,This changed my mind!,"Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot. I took one bit of this thinking I'd be giving the rest of it to my 2 year old daughter. It was DELICIOUS!!! Needless to say, she didn't get any of the cookie. :o) Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying this again!!"
1663,B007JFMH8M,5,Awesome cookie!,"I am a huge fan of soft cookies so this is top of the line!  I love how soft and flavorful they are.  since they are individually wrapped, it keeps them soft and fresh!"
1664,B007JFMH8M,5,A home run!,I put this is my dad's lunch because he always wants something sweet but I want him to eat healthy. I'm a health-nut & the ingredients in this cookie didn't scare me away. My dad said it tasted home-made (in a good way) & seemed really fresh. The portion size was also good.
1665,B007JFMH8M,5,These Are Amazing!!!,I didn't even get a chance to eat this because my 3 sons STOLE it from me.  They LOVED IT!!! I will absolutely buy these again!!!
1666,B007JFMH8M,4,loved it!,Im not the biggest fan of oatmeal but I really liked this cookie so much that I went and bought a couple boxes!
1667,B007JFMH8M,4,really good,I really liked them they was the best box of cookies I gotten so far I will be getting them again real soon
1668,B007JFMH8M,4,Free Sample-good thing,I received a sample of the Quaker Oatmeal cookie in my Influenster voxbox. I'm not a fan of raisins so I let my daughter try it. She loved it. She said she enjoyed the raisins and liked the soft cookie instead of a regular crunchy one.
1669,B007JFMH8M,4,Good & Soft Cookie,"The Quaker Cookie, was a great soft cookie to eat. My 3 years old daughter really enjoyed the treat! It was soft, there wasn't any after taste to the cookie.. Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the Quaker Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)"
1670,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,"I received a sample of this product from Influenster. My daughter and I split it and it was delicious. I'm going to have to check Kroger to see if they have them, because my Walmart did not.  :("
1671,B007JFMH8M,5,Love this cookie!,"When Influenster and Quaker sent me this cookie to try, it looked delicious--but healthy-so you never know!  But, I was delighted because it is good for you and Great Tasting!  Love it!"
1672,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum!,"These cookies are great! So yummy! My little boy loved these cookies! Since they are in individual packages, they are great for purses and diaper bags!"
1673,B007JFMH8M,4,Tastes Homemade,"Quaker has yet to disappoint.  I am not a big fan of raisins, but these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are the best!  Very chewy and fresh, great for on the go or kids lunches!"
1674,B007JFMH8M,3,Quaker Soft Baked Cookie,I thought the cookie was good. It was soft and chewy; however I prefer organic foods and would much  rather have a freshly baked cookie!
1675,B007JFMH8M,5,Hide the box,These cookies were so very scrumptious. They taste homemade and I won't lie... I gobbled it down in mere seconds. I will be purchasing many more.
1676,B007JFMH8M,5,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins","Wow, a soft moist & delicious cookie~Quaker has done it again.  Great snack for on the go or to enjoy at home with a nice glass of cold milk.<br /><br /> This cookie is large enough to share with two if you have little ones.  The added bonus is its nutritional value!  Grab a box and enjoy!"
1677,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,These are great especially for little hands.  I love how soft Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are.  My son really can't get enough of these things!
1678,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"Love the cookies!  I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was.  I am not usually a soft cookie fan but this one was an exception.  Also, this is a pretty healthy choice if you are craving sweets."
1679,B007JFMH8M,5,Fantastic Cookie,"This cookie was great. It was a little soft, but that's what made it even better. It didn't take long for it to vanish, which might be a bad thing if you lack self control (something I do not possess). I recommend these to everyone unless you are allergic to raisins."
1680,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy cookie,"This cookie is so soft and taste amazing! I was so surprised with how moist and chewy it was, better than home made, believe it or not. My whole family were begging for more, highly recommend trying this!"
1681,B007JFMH8M,5,Just like homemade!,I received this cookie in my Influenster voxbox and LOVED it! It tasted just like what I would make at home. Delicious!
1682,B007JFMH8M,4,Great product,I received this product thru Influenster and Quaker in my MomVox box. I opened it jn front of my 8 year old which he took off running with it and later came back and told me that he needs it for his snack at summer camp. We went out and bought a box and he takes one every morning for camp. Love it!!!
1683,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker soft baked oatmel cookie,I have tried this from Influenster and its delish! I also purchased more of this because it became my son's favorite snack! Love it too! :)
1684,B007JFMH8M,5,Excellent Cookie!,"I received this cookie from Influenster and Quaker in my Mom VoxBox. I was so excited to get the chance to try this cookie. Then it came and my youngest took it before I got the chance! I was so disappointed but from what I understand from him it is one of the best cookies he has ever had, and it tastes better than the cookies I bake him at home."
1685,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,"The Quaker Oatmeal cookies are deliciously soft, the cookies are individually wrapped, and I like that because you can take one package on the go and have a good snack a healthy one. I like this Raisins cookies a lot."
1686,B007JFMH8M,4,I did find these to be quite good,"Quaker Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)"
1687,B007JFMH8M,5,Just like mama's ?  Maybe.....,No-one should do oatmeal better than Quaker ....right? Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.
1688,B007JFMH8M,4,just like grandma used to make!,"These cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. Very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!"
1689,B007JFMH8M,3,Soft and Dry,I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality
1690,B007JFMH8M,3,"Not so chewy, a bit dry","Maybe it was the hot weather? Maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br />These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.<br /><br />Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.<br /><br />Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced."
1691,B007JFMH8M,3,Eh?,"These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products."
1692,B007JFMH8M,4,Pretty Guilt Free and Tasty,"I really liked these cookies. They are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. They worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).  They aren't coated in sugar the way a lot of prepackaged oatmeal cookies are.  Each cookie is individually packaged and is easy to open on the go.<br /><br />I'd totally buy these the next time I see them in the store."
1693,B007JFMH8M,4,"Tasty and a nice, quick snack","Quaker is pretty much the oatmeal company, and they have done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie. I liked the convenience of being individually wrapped, which also preserves its freshness. I take one of these along during a round of golf and in my lunch. The cookie is tasty, light and moist. I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin."
1694,B007JFMH8M,3,Like the vending machine,"These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.  The taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too ""processed,"" not like simple and fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.  I would not recommend them personally, although my little ones liked them fine (although I rarely know kids to say ""no"" to a cookie!)."
1695,B007JFMH8M,3,Daughter LOVES it!,"I got to this in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I don't like oatmeal cookies. So I had my daughter try it and she LOVED it. She said ""Mom, this cookie is really good. Is there another one. I only got one."" I told her no that, that was all. She was really bummed. But I told her that when we go to the store and if we see them we'll make sure to buy them since she likes them so much."
1696,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Tasting!,"Cookies are delicious and very soft, i expected a much different taste but to my surpise they were actually great. I got a sample so i will be purchasing these for my family soon."
1697,B007JFMH8M,5,Kids love it.,"I was given a chance to sample this cookie when I got my Mom vox box from Influenster and Quaker, much thanks. The kids and I shared the cookie it was soft and chewy really good we will be buying them again."
1698,B007JFMH8M,3,It was very yummy but very soft!,"I was really excited to get this Quaker Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft."

1703,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum!,"This is the best prepackaged cookie I've ever had! They have great flavor, are soft and chewy, and just everything you would expect in a homemade cookie! I was given it in an Influenster voxbox and I can say that I will be purchasing these very often!"
1704,B007JFMH8M,5,soft baked yuumy cookie,i actually tried this cookie through influenster is was really chewy which is how i like my cookies i dont like them hard and crunchy its very good but the after taste left in you mouth is kinda nasty but overall one good cookie
1705,B007JFMH8M,5,delicious,"i received this product from influenster to test!!.. i loved it it was so soft and delicious i would have not bought this if i went to the store because it is ""healthy"".. but after tasting it i will definitely be buying more!!"
1706,B007JFMH8M,5,Very tasty cookie!,"I recently tried this cookie as part of an Influenster Mom Vox Box.  Influenster sends out free boxes of products in order for you to test them and give them your feedback. I really enjoyed this cookie!  Most packaged cookies are hard and taste like cardboard but I was pleasantly surprised that this cookie was soft and comparable to a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie.  The nutritional facts weren't too bad for a dessert too.  It was very yummy and filling.  A good sized cookie!  I will definitely be buying some for my family, since I ate this one myself ;)"
1707,B007JFMH8M,5,True Homemade Flavor and Texture!,"I received a free cookie from Influenster, and it made my week. I normally avoid packaged cookies because I like the chewy freshness of homemade so much better. These had an amazing flavor of cinnamon and spice, and the texture was perfect. I need to go get my own box!"
1708,B007JFMH8M,4,Delicious,"I was given a sample of these Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster.com as part of their Mom VoxBox 2012 for reviewing. I shared my cookie with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. As with any cookie, she loved it! I thought the cookie was delicious. Not overly sweet, but had perfect flavor. It was moist too, unlike some cookies that are dry. My least favorite part was how crumbly it was. It did have a tendancy to crumble quite a bit. Overall, it was a great cookie."
1709,B007JFMH8M,5,YUMMY!,"I received this delicious treat complimentary of Influenster in my Mom voxbox. I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)"
1710,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious Treat for the Whole Family!,"I got the opportunity to taste test these awesome cookies from Influenster and Quaker in their Mom VoxBox and found the cookie to be absolutely delicious! It was soft and chewy, just how I like my cookies! My four year old and I shared it and half was enough for each of us and he loved it too!"
1711,B007JFMH8M,5,yummmmmmmmmm,I received the Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies from influenster in the mombox. I was very pleased. Not only was it a great sized cookie and was also very soft. It was not dry and it tasted great. i will definitely be purchasing this product!
1712,B007JFMH8M,4,Wonderful Snack!!,"I received the Oatmeal cookie complementary in my Influenster Mom Voxbox and I couldn't be more impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the taste! I will definitely be buying more, especially now that I know they come in these amazing flavors!! Yummy! They are great to have on the go and especially delicious warmed up with some milk!!  And they are not too expensive on the calorie bank either!"
1713,B007JFMH8M,3,Tastey!,"I tried these cookies as a sample from influnster.com. They are a little sweet for my taste, the kids loved it. They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!"
1714,B007JFMH8M,5,Something for the whole family!,"I received a cookie as part of an Influenster review. I love that it tastes like a fresh cookie from Grandma's oven. I knew I would love it, but was uber pleased to see that my 2 year old loves it as well. This is definitely something that will replace a fruit snack!"
1715,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!!,I received a complimentary Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster.com for review purposes. This cookie is huge and hearty! This is literally the first Oatmeal Cookie I have ever been able to get my picky teenage son to eat! Very soft! Just like homemade! Quaker has really outdone themselves!
1716,B007JFMH8M,4,Love them,"I received this item from Influenster and loved them so much thaton my next grocery trip I purchased three boxed.  I received the oatmeal raisin from Influenster and I also purchased the banana nut and the chocolate almond.  The raisin was my favorite soft and moist, loved them"
1717,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker oatmeal cookies taste delicious!,"These cookies are amazing! They are moist, flavorful and are really satisfying. I can't wait to add them to my teenagers lunches in the fall!"
1718,B007JFMH8M,4,Great alternative to homemade,"I was really surprised at how good these are! Very soft and chewy, however maybe a little too soft. I recently packed them in a lunch and got complaint that they crumbled"
1719,B007JFMH8M,5,Very Soft and Yummy,"These were very tasty, my three year old son even gobbled them up! They are very soft, and as long as you like oatmeal cookies you will love these!"
1720,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,Yumm yumm yumm we loved them like that way they are soft for the kids and they taste so good
1721,B007JFMH8M,4,Really good!,"Bought these for my husband and he really likes them! I haven't tried them yet, but I'm going to give them a shot."
1722,B007JFMH8M,5,Not bad at all,"For an Oatmeal Raisin cookie this isn't bad at all. Nice and soft, great taste. I like the other flavors of this cookie as well."
1723,B007JFMH8M,5,Holla Holla at this Cookie y'all!,"I got a sample of these yummy thangs in my Influenster Mom VoxBox and they are delicious! I shared mine with my toddler and she also loved it, cried when we ran out of cookie! They are nice and soft and really tasty! Go on and get you some, girl!"
1724,B007JFMH8M,5,Amazingly good!,"I love Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They taste so good! They are moist, soft, and just the right size! The first cookie i had i received in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.com. It was so good that the next day I went out and got a whole box! They are great for on the go snacks. I keep one in my purse for when I need a little snack! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a>"
1725,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum,I also received a sample of this cookie from Influenster.  My daughter really enjoyed it. I think it is a little high in sugar to make it a regular treat but I would repurchase it in the future.
1726,B007JFMH8M,5,So good you need to put them in the trunk on the way home from the store if you don't want to sneak into the box,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:<br /><br />-Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving<br /><br />Definite buy, if on sale stock up."
1727,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy cookie,I recieve sample of this cookie from Influenster to try out. I normally dislike cookie with raisins but this one was good. I will not get these again but thats not because it wasn't a good cookie its because of the raisins. I will how ever try these in other flavors.
1728,B007JFMH8M,5,"tastes like homebaked cookies, just so much easier to ""make""","I love these cookies. They have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. The opinion expressed herein are my own personal opinion and have not been influenced by Influenster or any other third party."
1729,B007JFMH8M,5,Picky Eater loves them,"I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there."
1730,B007JFMH8M,5,Great cookies!!,I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were much more moist then other brands. Also I like the fact that it's made with whole grain quaker oats and it provides a good source of fiber. These are a great thing for kids to eat!! [...]
1731,B007JFMH8M,5,Taste Like Mom's Homemade Cookies,"I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.  I have been a big fan of oatmeal cookies all my life and I put this right on top.  What really impressed me was the sofeness and the taste was just awesome.  If I didn't know better, I'd think they came right out the oven. Lets not forget the wholesome ingredients it contain.  You couldn't ask for a better cookie.  If I didn't know better, I think my mom made these."
1732,B007JFMH8M,5,Amazingly DELICIOUS,"I received a cookie from Influenster. I am not a big fan of oatmeal and raisin cookies,not since my Granny spoiled my taste buds. Ever since then I have tried to find cookies on the market that were comparable to hers, with no luck. I was surprised by this cookie! It tastes so close to the homemade ones that my Granny used to make!! The size is enormous and the raisins are soft and chewy. Definitely worth buying! LOVE IT!"
1733,B007JFMH8M,5,Yumm,I really dislike oatmeal cookies and raisins..I got a cookie from influenster and this cookie was awesome and made me change my mind about oatmeal raisin cookies. I would def. get these again.
1734,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious !,"I am not a big fan of raisin cookies, But I had a taste of their raisin oatmeal cookies & they were delicious ! I am surprised my son loved them too.

1737,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Rasins,"First let me say that I tried this product because I received it in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster as a complementary test product.  That said, these cookies are off the hook delicious.  They really do taste just like homemade (I know, because I make my own all the time).<br /><br />I only ate a bite because my son was chomping at the bit to have it and as soon as his little hands got ahold of this cookie, it was gone in seconds and he was asking for more.  We'll certainly be buying a box to keep for when it's just too hot to turn on the oven and make our own!"
1738,B007JFMH8M,4,Very moist and delicious!,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were truly much more moist then other brands.  They had a good oatmeal flavor and were packed with raisins, but were not as sweet as I expected.  After a few bites, I found just a little bit of the cookie was the perfect amount to fill me up and calm my sweet tooth.<br /><br />*I received a free sample of this product from VoxBox in order to provide an honest and accurate review."
1739,B007JFMH8M,5,Love these,I was Fortunate enough to be sent this item through influenster. I really enjoyed the cookie. It was delicious soft goodness that didn't make me feel as guilty as eating an Oreo<br />Thank you Quaker!

1754,B007JFMH8M,5,MUST ORDER FOR MY BOYS (and me!),"These are perfect for on the go...we are often rushing out the door and I often grab something as the door is closing.  These are perfect to fill you up and give you the start to the day that you need.

1766,B007JFMH8M,5,Best snack ever!,I will be going to get more of these tonight! My 15 1/2 month old son just loves them and I like giving them as an afternoon snack for him.

1771,B007JFMH8M,5,cookie,Wasn't sure if this cookie was going to be as it was described but it was more than what I thought. It was so soft and I love soft cookies I tried the rasian one cant wait to try the rest
1772,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft baked Quaker cookie ( influenster sample),I am not a huge fan of raisins but the Quaker brand has always been one I loved. I did try the cookie and it was so soft and melted in my mouth . Had a great and healthy taste of whole grains and overall is a good Cookie.
1773,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker soft baked. Yum,"I really enjoyed these cookies. Great taste and very filling!! Great to pack in lunch, picnic- kids snack. Great that they come individually wrapped- easy to throw in your purse or bag. I would recommend these for kids and adults!"
1774,B007JFMH8M,4,good cookie,i am not an oatmeal cookie lover but I will say that I loved this cookie !!!!!!!!!! it was soft and chewy and that what makes it good
1775,B007JFMH8M,5,quaker soft cookies,They are amazing. So good and soft chewy. I so recommend them.my kids evwn enjoyed them. I will be purchasing these
1776,B007JFMH8M,4,QuakerOats GOOD!,These were pretty great. We got the Oatmeal Raisin but to me they tasted like Pumpkin Pie which was even better. My husband and three year old liked them as well. Especially the three year old. These cookies were pretty great. Very dense so one is definitely enough. I want to try another flavor next time too! Maybe something with chocolate!
1777,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and Flavorful Cookie,"I recently received a sample of this cookie, and I enjoyed it!  The cookie was soft and not too dry.  It was a little spicier than I generally like my oatmeal cookies, but it definitely had some flavor. I wouldn't say that it's my favorite oatmeal cookie ever, but I would be very okay with eating more of them  :)"
1778,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft and Chewy,"This individually wrapped cookie was moist, soft and chewy. The taste was perfect and it was beyond expectations, the perfect bite."

1781,B007JFMH8M,5,YummY,We recently got one of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies to try ViA Influenster and Quaker. And my family loved them! They don't taste store bought at all. They tasted home made!! Very soft and moist!
1782,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker Cookie,"Upon recieving this cookie in my voxbox from influenster I sceptical because you expect cookies in a package to be very dry and more often than not tasteless, the cookie recieved in the package was surprisingly moist and very flavorful, it tasted very good and I will definately purchase them in the future."
1783,B007JFMH8M,5,Oh so Tasty,"My daughter and I tried the soft baked oatmeal cookies and we both agreed it's delicious!  I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.  The oatmeal doesn't overpower the raisins and the raisins don't overpower the oatmeal, it's a perfect balance.  The raisin were soft, not hard like other brands we've tried in the past.  The price for the quality is well worth it."
1784,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy and Soft Baked! Yeah!,"I absolutely fell in love with these cookies.  I love my cookies soft and not hard, unless it's an Oreo and then I soften it in milk, but these cookies are hands down the closest I've had to homemade!"
1785,B007JFMH8M,4,Pretty Darn Good,Less calories than a candy bar! I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available.
1786,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,Got a free sample cookie from @influenster's Mom voxbox. These cookies are great they are soft and chewy and left me wanting more!
1787,B007JFMH8M,4,Chewy and tasty,I was given a sample of the Quaker Chewy oatmeal cookie from Influenster. I enjoyed the taste and texture of my cookie. I will buy them again if they are on sale or I have a coupon to use.
1788,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked!,"There is one thing that I love, I love eating something absolutely delicious and knowing that what I am eating is actually healthy and jampacked full of nutrients!!!

1793,B007JFMH8M,4,really soft,liked the flavor just wished it had more oatmeal in the cookie. But i do like how soft it was!!
1794,B007JFMH8M,4,loved the cookie just not the flavor,I loved the softness of this cookie but not to keen on oatmeal but I will be buying more of these just not in that flavor. my kids loved the cookie!
1795,B007JFMH8M,3,individually wrapped,"I've always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son.  he loves soft cookies, so I was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives."
1796,B007JFMH8M,4,Tasty,"The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me)."
1797,B007JFMH8M,3,"Okay, Tasty but Okay","Nice flavor, and only 70 calories per cookie; the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying."
1798,B007JFMH8M,5,Everyone in the family loves these cookies.,"These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an ""oatmeal"" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies."
1799,B007JFMH8M,4,Tasty but a little dry,"These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices."
1800,B007JFMH8M,4,Not bad for a packaged cookie,"These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either."
1801,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and tasty,"These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced ""soft"" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don't expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I've had worse (Chips Ahoy ""chewy gooey"" for instance)."
1802,B007JFMH8M,2,Blech,"These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are ""soft-baked"", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don't taste that good.<br /><br />I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter."
1803,B007JFMH8M,3,SOFT BUT UNFORTUNATELY DRY AND GRITTY,"I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative."
1804,B007JFMH8M,4,pretty good,"For a product like this, it's pretty good. Soft, tasty, seemed fresh. They didn't last long at my house. I thought they were a bit too sweet, but the kids loved them. I'd rather eat home-made, but this is the next best thing."
1805,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"Quaker cookies have always been one of my favorites and these do not disapoint. These cookies are so delicious! They are soft and chewy and scrumptious. My kids love them, I love them, this is definitely on my shopping list :)"

1816,B007JFMH8M,4,A good soft cookie,"This was one of the best soft cookies I've had in a while that was store brought. I am not a big fan of raisins but this cookie made me forget all about them. If you are thinking about buying these, they are a good buy. A Great snack for Adults and children."
1817,B007JFMH8M,5,Great in-between snack!,"I was desperate for something to eat but had to rush rush rush out of the house for a family emergency.  I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I grabbed one of these cookies and headed out the door.  As I drove to pick my son up from school, I ate the cookie and was surprised at how satisfied I was.  No more growling or stomach pains.  And the fullness lasted until dinner!"
1818,B007JFMH8M,5,Great taste,"These quaker cookies are so great, they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run."
1819,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"I received a sample of the Quaker oatmeal raisin soft baked cookies (courtesy of Influenster.com) about a month ago and since then I haven't purchased any other oatmeal cookie. I love them and most important my daughter loves them. These make the perfect snack for lunch, at day at the park or beach, or a midnight snack. Best part is they are healthy and don't make you feel bad for ""cheating"" a little on your diet. There's so much to say but to sum it all up....they are DELICIOUS!!!"

1822,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"I received one of these cookies as a sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox. I didn't think I'd like it because I'm not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies. The plan was to give it to my husband who loves them. Well, before he could get it, my daughter snatched it up. She doesn't like raisins but loved this cookie! I talked her into giving me a bite and it was really good! It was really soft, not dry. I have been trying to find them in the store to buy some more but so far haven't had any luck."
1823,B007JFMH8M,5,Mom Vox Box,I received a sample of these in my summer mom voxbox from influenster and as soon as we opened it everyone wanted a piece and we had to share! One cookie just wasn't enough...I'll have to buy more..they were so soft and tasted like it was freshly baked..not overly sweet and the raisins were plump and soft...highly recommend!

I thought it was tasty; however, I'm not likely to purchase it with frequency because I try to avoid packaged foods, and do not store a lot of sweets in the house for the kids. I would however choose this over the competition. (I got this product as a free trial from influenster.com)"

My daughter just happened to ""go missing"" around the same time, and she's a mommy's girl and never leaves my side. So as I'm searching for her, I find her in my bathroom shower with the cookie almost ate up. I would have gave it to her anyway if she asked, but she hit it from me and ate it all herself! My daughter is extremely finicky when it comes to snacks, but this she gobbled right up. A cookie you can't go wrong with and good for them too!"

They aren't too sweet which is perfect for an oatmeal raisin cookie and they are perfectly soft.  These are perfect for a lunch box treat or for a road trip.

I took a bite and gave the rest to my son, which was gone before I even had a chance to change my mind. LOL One of the moistest, most delicious cookies I have ever had, hands down. The only drawback that I found was that my cookies was broken into about 5 pieces, not sure what happened, but that doesn't effect the flavor!"
1884,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum!,These cookies are so good. They taste homemade! Very tasty and healthy! Usually I only think oatmeal when I think of Quaker...I was wrong!I got a free sample from Influenster! :)  I will be buying for sure!
1885,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"When I tried the cookie I noticed that it was very soft, moist, and chewy. I usually do not like raisins, but they were very good in this. They actually tasted like homemade to me. And I grew up with a grandmother who always had fresh baked cookies in the kitchen. Having three kids of my own, of course I had to share with them. My son's comment on the cookie was, ""That's really yummy, Mommy!"" I am pretty sure we will be purchasing these in the future because my two boys keep asking if there is another cookie in my VoxBox.<br />I received a sample of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins in my MomVoxBox from Influenster for review purposes only. All opinions are my own."
1886,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"This cookie is so good, I received a sample from Influenster and when I opened it, it smelled like a homemade cookie...it tastes so fresh and it is filling, you only need one and you are good to go! I will be buying these in the future!"

I had seen them on commercials but never remembered to buy them when we went to the market, but I will definitely remember to buy them now!! What a delicious cookie and it is good for you too! Me and my son enjoyed our cookie with our lunch and it was a hit with both of us. It was such a soft and flavorful cookie that filled you up and left you satisfied. I will definitely be trying other varieties of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and will be recommending them to hall my friends!"
1888,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum yum,These cookies are very good. My daughter tried the sample and then I went out and bought a box. The whole family loves them. They are very soft and moist. It is a new snack in our household!
1889,B007JFMH8M,4,Really great!,"I received an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie in a Influenster box and I loved it! Tasted just like a homemade cookie, really fresh and chewy. I would definitely buy more!"
1890,B007JFMH8M,5,LOVE THESE!,These cookies where so great and yummy! took my candy craving away!  you should for sure buy this! The rasins are great and fufilling
1891,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft & Delicious Oatmeal Raisin,I received Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie as a sample in the mail. The cookie is really soft and a very nice size. The raisins taste very fresh and it's just like eating a freshly baked cookie; you could even put in the microwave for a bit to get the fresh oven baked feel.
1892,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,Received this in my influenster box my son Loved it! : )  Had to purchase more. It was nice to be able to try something to see if I liked it first before purchasing it.
1893,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker oatmeal cookie,These cookies are very delicious! They are nice and soft so i could even give them to my 2 year old.
1894,B007JFMH8M,5,One Year Old Son Loves these! @quakeroats,"This morning I gave my son a quaker oats rasin cookie for breakfast. When we took it out of the package it smelled amazing. I wish I was able to try this with him, but I have celiac and am gluten free. However my one year old son gobbled it up. It was super soft and chewy. There were visible oats and lots of rasins. I like that they were healthy. I did not mind giving this for breakfast as a treat because they are quaker oats!"
1895,B007JFMH8M,5,Awesome Cookie,"I don't usually like Oatmeal Raisin cookies, but when Influenster sent me this cookie to try, I did, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved it! So great, so soft, and so delicious. I definitely recommend that everyone try this cookie."
1896,B007JFMH8M,5,Amazing Cookie,I received this Quaker Soft Baked cookie from Influenster. This was my first time trying it and ohhh my!! It was fresh tasting. Very chewy and busting with flavor.
1897,B007JFMH8M,5,Very Soft Yummy Cookies,I love these cookies!!!! They are very soft and actually taste like the homemade cookies your grandma would bake. Which is a great compliment to Quaker considering I think my Grandma is the best cookie baker ever! I also like that the cookies are a good snack that are not super high in calories. I will for sure be buying these cookies again and recommending them to all of my friends.
1898,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy and kids loved it,"I received this from Influenster in the Mom Voxbox. When I offered to my kids to try the Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookie I literally had a crying baby on my hands. She did NOT want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says ""I's MINE!"" Even getting a new box ""It's mine"" have to hide it.  Thanks!! Annette G"
1899,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Taste and Super Soft,"I know they say ""soft baked"" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!  These are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry."
1900,B007JFMH8M,5,Healthy and yummy too,We love these! They are so soft and tasty. They are a healthy filling snack. So easy to just stick in your bag and enjoy on the go!
1901,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Snack!,"These were great! These cookies were soft and very tasty, almost like fresh baked.  They were much larger than I expected. Great product, you won't be disappointed."
1902,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,"This cookie was so soft, and delicious. I definitely plan on buying more! Perfect snack to have on the go or just at home with a glass of milk."
1903,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,"The cookie is amazing, very soft. My daughters ages 4 years old and 10 months couldn't resist them. I had to buy another box right away."
1904,B007JFMH8M,5,loved em,"they are great, tasty and delicisous.  We even tried the banana nut ones, they were fantastic we loved them.  My kids loved them a great breakfast on the go..."
1905,B007JFMH8M,4,Great tasting and very filling!,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one."
1906,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummers!,"Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again."
1907,B007JFMH8M,3,"Nice texture, not so much taste","This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!"
1908,B007JFMH8M,4,Good Buy Here......Average Oatmeal Cookie,"As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )"
1909,B007JFMH8M,4,Great Flavor But Too Dry,"Quaker soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!"
1910,B007JFMH8M,2,Not bad but not good either,"I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening."
1911,B007JFMH8M,1,Way too much oat bran = chewy but dry cookies,"I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these ""cookies"". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!"
1912,B007JFMH8M,3,Good Taste and Flavor But a Little on the Dry Side,"This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!"
1913,B007JFMH8M,4,Pretty Good Cookie,"First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for ""store-bought."" If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too."
1914,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and chewy but a bit too sweet!,"I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how Quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.<br /><br />For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.<br /><br />It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood."
1915,B007JFMH8M,4,Delicious!,I loved these cookies! My daughter eat them right up. They are soft and taste great. I like softer cookies and this one was a hit with my whole family.
1916,B007JFMH8M,2,"Just ""meh"" - Definiately not a healthy choice!","Chock full of sugar!  Absolutely not something I would serve to my family.  Obviously, all cookies have sugar in them, but these seem to be a bit excessive."
1917,B007JFMH8M,4,Just like homemade!,"I recently received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.  I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two ""cookie monsters"" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)"
1918,B007JFMH8M,5,Tasty and chewy,"I got these in the Mom VoxBox from Influenster, and was excited to try them!<br />They are chewy and delish! I can see these disappearing and having an empty box sitting around!<br /><br />I'm not a fan of hard crunchy type cookies, so these were right up my alley!"
1919,B007JFMH8M,5,Prefect Treat for My Little Guy!,My 3 1/2 year old loved this cookie!  We shared it and I'm pretty sure he would have eaten the whole thing!  Very soft and th perfect amount of sweetness- not overly sweet like some oatmeal cookies tend to be.
1920,B007JFMH8M,4,Healthy Goodnesss,Very soft and chewy! Love the homestyle taste of the cookie and that it is very nutrious! Definetly gotta get some more!
1921,B007JFMH8M,3,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"Well, let me start by saying these cookies are very soft and moist. However, I did not really like them. They were not sweet (which is a matter of personal preference) and they had a gritty texture to them."
1922,B007JFMH8M,5,Best Store Bought Cookie EVER,These cookies are delicious. They are full of flavor and taste moist and fresh. My kids loved them!!! My expectations were exceeded!
1923,B007JFMH8M,5,Very yummy and soft,This cookie is one of the best cookies that i have tried in a while since i do not like the hard crunchy ones like chips ahoy because it is so soft to the bite and pulls you in to make you want more. You can taste all the ingredents none are hidden and has a good amount of raisins in the cookie. I will be buying these for my family as long as they make them.
1924,B007JFMH8M,5,Homemade Cookie,"Quaker Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy. I feel good about buying this because the ingredients are simple & I have used Quaker for years. Is a much better alternative than the other regular cookies you see in the store. Packed with raisins & whole grains. Great to pack, on road trips or just in your purse. Kid tested and approved! I received this product complimentary to test through Influenster's VoxBox program."
1925,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Bakes are DELICIOUS!,"I have absolutely fallen in love with the soft baked cookies! My kids love them, and I love them as a treat to munch on. However, they also can be used in delicious cookie crusts or cookie crumbles for recipes! They are so versatile and delicious! I definitely recommend them to everyone! my husband isn't even an oatmeal fan, but LOVES these cookies!!"
1926,B007JFMH8M,5,gone too quick,"These cookies are to die for. I ate mine in a matter of seconds and was ready for the next one, but I only had one. I recommend these cookies for anyone kids, adults and the elderly. Its deliciously soft packed with raisins and yumminess!! Go to the store now and buy them, you sure wont be disappointed."
1927,B007JFMH8M,5,I LOVE these!,"These are soft, chewy, and delicious! They really do taste just like homemade cookies... with natural ingredients. They are a perfect treat, but still feel like a bit of a healthy snack as well.<br /><br />* I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster"
1928,B007JFMH8M,5,Loved It,I let me daughter try some and I ate the rest. She isn't big on raisins but it was still good to her. I thought it was delicious because it was soft and tasted like it was just baked from the oven. I would highly recommend it and who doesn't love a good homemade cookie. Cause that's what it felt like to me. Like someone had just gave me a freshly baked cookie.
1929,B007JFMH8M,5,Soooo good!,"I received this product through my Influenster Mom VoxBox. My son immediately ate it up and said to me it was ""the best he had ever had"". My son is four mind you! So this must mean something. I would definitely go out and buy some for my household after hearing that reaction :)"
1930,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum!,This product was provided to me for free through Influenster. My family love these cookies. They are soft and slightly chewy. My 2 yr old will only eat these oatmeal cookies. So he really enjoyed them.

Even my husband thought it was great and he does not really like oatmeal cookies. I will buy these now!"

1936,B007JFMH8M,5,"Soft, chewy and delicious",I recently received a sample of this Quaker Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and I couldn't put it down.  The cookie is a nice big size and is full of flavor. Its not overly sweet and has that homebaked taste to it.  I can't wait to get more.
1937,B007JFMH8M,5,These were delicious!,"I received one of these to try for free and review from Influenster in my mom Voxbox and I have to say, it was the softest, chewiest cookie I've ever had. This is saying a lot since I'm picky about cookies being soft and chewy. I'm anxious to try the other flavors. Especially the Apple Cinnamon one! Yum!"

I don't usally reach for oatmeal cookies they are just not my favorite or my son's favorite. I love how homemade they taste. Nice and soft real taste of oatmeal and raisins. I will definetly continue buying some of these especially because enjoyed them!.
1940,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious!,These are SO yummy! They are incredibly soft and take me back to my childhood when my grandma would make oatmeal raisin cookies. My toddler loves them too!
1941,B007JFMH8M,5,So good and so good for you!!,I have always loved Quaker brand products.  I had recieved a Oatmeal Rasin cookie through @influenster to try and review.  My boys actually were going to fight over who got to eat the cookie so I did the old one kid break it in half and the other one choose what half he wants trick.  They were left wanting more!  I have already repurchased these cookies several times in different flavors.  I am happy that they are good for them and make a great snack.
1942,B007JFMH8M,5,So Good!,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies are incredibly soft and chewy! And they taste so good! Definitely the best store bought cookie out there! I received a free sample via Influenster.

1946,B007JFMH8M,4,Loved!,I really loved this cookie. The calories in it are not bad and the taste is great. I am always looking for a quick on the go breakfast and this hits the nail on the head. It would go amazingly with a cup of coffee. The cookie was soft and full of flavor. The only thing that I didn't love was it kind of had a salty after taste. If the sodium could be reduced just a smidgen then it would be the best cookie I have ever tasted. I would buy these if our commissary would carry them!
1947,B007JFMH8M,5,soft & chewy,"I got a free sample via influenster, I'm not gonna lie the Quaker cookie was the first thing that caught my eye. First of its was so soft & chewy its just melts in your mouth. I definetly stocked up on the cookies. I tried the oatmeal cookie & its still my fav!!"

1951,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies testing experience @ Influenster,"I've had other store bought cookies, these are better quality - more deluxe. I buy and bake a lot of gluten free for my son, so this was a real treat and just for me! A great snack for on the go."
1952,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum,"I really liked this cookie. It was very soft and chewy just how I like my cookies. The only problem was it could have been sweeter, maybe with some chocolate chips in with the raisins it would have been even better. I think for a quick breakfast great choice, not so much as a sweet though."

1958,B007JFMH8M,5,Better Than Homemade!,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are better than any homemade cookies I have tried or made. Which says alot considering I'm a former baker. They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies. They're especially great for on the go snacks.Also the price is very reasonable considering the quality you get. So if you're a cookie fan this one you have to try, you won't be disappointed."

I original received a sample from influenster website but have since purchased them since my girls ate my original influenster provided cookie."
1969,B007JFMH8M,5,Love!,"These are wonderful. I love love love soft cookies, and oatmeal raisin are my favorite! I mostly make my own cookies, but I would definitely purchase these! I got them compliments of Influenster & Quaker to test out, and my son & I love them!"

1980,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Snack!,The size of the cookie was great and filling especially for a quick snack for a busy mom or even your children. I will buy this again for sure!

1984,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft & Chewy Yumminess!!,"This cookie only lasted a few mins in my house. I my son ate most of it but I did get a couple bits of it & it was so soft, which is how I love my cookies, it was also very moist and nice & chewy. I will defiantly be buying these again."

1989,B007JFMH8M,3,So good!,"I love chewy cookies! And these are definitely chewy. I love it. But the downside is that it's made in a place that manufactures peanuts. My Bubs is allergic to peanuts. =\ So, he couldn't have any."
1990,B007JFMH8M,5,Awesome cookie!,"I received this cookie courtesy of influenster, my family loves oatmeal cookies, and this one was awesome!! My son and I shared it, very soft and full of moist raisins! Will for sure look for these in the store! Can't wait to try others!"
1991,B007JFMH8M,5,The Best Oatmeal Cookie I Ever Ate!,"I received a sample of these cookies through Influenster.It was gone within a minute of receiving the package.I didn't even share it,all mine lol.They are super soft and delicious!They taste like I just baked them myself.I have never tasted such an amazing cookie,for real!"
1992,B007JFMH8M,3,Nice,"I received this sample of Quaker Soft Baked Cookie via Influenster to try. My husband grabbed it up quickly, He liked the taste but says the texture could be better it seemed to crumble very easily."
1993,B007JFMH8M,5,amazing cookies!,these are very good. i didnt think they would be as moist as they were but they were melt in the mouth good :)
1994,B007JFMH8M,4,Mmmmmm,These are really good. My husband and daughter fought over them!!  They are so soft and chewy and they taste like cinnamon.
1995,B007JFMH8M,5,A Delicious Snack,"This is the perfect pick-me-up snack.  Great flavor and perfectly filling.  I quickly regretted sharing with my husband.  This snack is great for the entire family, and knowing we're making a healthier choice is a good feeling."
1996,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker made this??,"I received a sample courtesy Influenster, well... I didn't have the pleasure to taste it myself, because my son got ahold of it and started munching away!!  He absolutely loved this cookie :)  And that's saying alot, since my son can not stand raisins, period!  I guess I'm gonna have to add this one to my grocery list :)"
1997,B007JFMH8M,5,2 THUMBS UP!,"I got a Quaker cookie to try in my Voxbox from Influenster. I gave it to my 8 year old son, who normally hates anything with raisins or anything remotely healthy, He loved it. Thanks Quaker for getting my child to eat something different."
1998,B007JFMH8M,5,Cookie Monster Munchkins!,"I received this cookie compliments of Quaker via Influenster to try. My son ate it so quick. I love Quaker and will be looking for these on our next grocery trip! My boy said it was delicious! We already buy the chewy oatmeal bars, adding these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies to our list of Quaket products!"
1999,B007JFMH8M,4,Didn't save any for the kids!,"I received the Raisin flavored from Influenster complimentary for tasting.  It was very good to me, not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies. The fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better.  I am going to buy the cranberry & yogurt next."
2000,B007JFMH8M,5,So soft and chewy!,I love the home baked mom taste these have! Just like my mom made them! They are also easy to find and affordable!
2001,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie,"I rec'd this product from influenster and Quaker for testing purposes. I've always enjoyed Quaker oats from the hot oatmeal, down to the cookie itself. Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie is made with whole grain Quaker oats, At least 10 grams of whole grains per serving.<br />Made with real fruit, Good source of fiber, delicious. Quaker oats been around since over a hundred years."
2002,B007JFMH8M,5,Wow...how soft and moist! :),I received one of these awesome cookies from Influenster! They are DELICIOUS!! Super soft and moist...tasted home made! :) Yummy!
2003,B007JFMH8M,4,Great cookie,These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins. This is only because I hate raisins. So if you like raisins then you would probably like them. I probably wouldn't repurchase this for myself because I would rather make homemade without them. I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins.
2004,B007JFMH8M,5,Just like Grandma used to make!,"Soft, chewy and just like Grandma used to make. I can't wait until I eat the next cookie as these are something to savor and enjoy!"
2005,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker Soft Baked Cookie,"From Influenster I received the Quaker Soft Baked Cookie. With this product, after dinner one night, I divided it up into 3 equal portions. One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our 1 1/2 year old daughter.<br />Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.<br /><br />I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first."
2006,B007JFMH8M,5,Love these!,My whole family absolutely loves these cookies...so soft and yummy!  And I like the fact that they are a nutritious treat for the kids...a much better option than candy or soda.
2007,B007JFMH8M,5,So yummy!,I loved how soft and delicious these cookies are! They are the new everyday snack in my house! Must have!
2008,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,I love the way these cookies taste just like homemade cookies. They are easy to take and eat on the go.
2009,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Makes The Best Oatmeal Cookies,"I thought that I might have had tried some of the tastiest oatmeal cookis before, but that wasn't so until I recently tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies . These cookies are so delicious. They taste just like homeade cookies. They are soft , full of raisins, and are just fabulous.I bought a box at my locl Walmart the other day for $2.18 for eight cookies. These are a good size cookie too. Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from Quaker I can't wait to try out the different varieties that Quaker carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks Quaker!! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box! They were A+++."
2010,B007JFMH8M,5,Nutritious and Delicious,I love this soft bake cookie I recived from Quaker!<br />I enjoyed the Nutritious soft baked cookie and I plan to buy more for my family! great taste and Price!1
2011,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy and nutritious,"The oatmeal raisin is the cookie that I've tried. I love it as well as my daughter. It's soft and tastes amazing. Not to mention cheap, I'll be buying more."
2012,B007JFMH8M,5,Healthy and Tasty Snack,"I really enjoyed the goodness of Quaker Oatmeal combined with soft, plump and juicy raisins in a soft cookie. It is an irrisistable snack for the entire family and leaves you feeling full and satisfied."
2013,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Cookies,These cookies are so delicious.. I received one in my influenster mom voxbox and just had to repurchase.. So soft and chewy..def a must buy..happy customer over here..good job quaker
2014,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy cookies!,"I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail."
2015,B007JFMH8M,3,Make sure you have a drink,"These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more ""oatmealy"" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it."
2016,B007JFMH8M,5,YES!!!,"Came as an 8-pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about 1/4 inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!"
2017,B007JFMH8M,3,Not bad for mass produced.  Not really great either.,"Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly."
2018,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum.,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack."
2019,B007JFMH8M,3,Plain,"Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with Quaker Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches."
2020,B007JFMH8M,2,Bland and dry,"I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!"
2021,B007JFMH8M,3,"Soft, but not very much flavor","As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again."
2022,B007JFMH8M,3,"tasty, but a tad on the dry side","I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up."
2023,B007JFMH8M,3,A Bit on the Sweet Side,"I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled ""oatmeal"" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible."
2024,B007JFMH8M,3,"okay, but nothing extraordinary","If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over."
2025,B007JFMH8M,5,Tasty and Nutritious!,"I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job, Quaker :)<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox."
2026,B007JFMH8M,4,Very good,I received this cookie to test from Influenster.  I had the raisin cookie and it was really so good!  I like that they use whole grains to make the cookie.  Breakfast really isn't my favorite meal of the day and I like something that is fast and easy.  This cookie is a good breakfast option for me.  I'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  The cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.  I really liked it and will be buying more!
2027,B007JFMH8M,4,Chewy And Delicious,"I love how these Quaker soft baked cookies taste. I love them warmed up or cold, either way they are quick and easy to eat on the go."
2028,B007JFMH8M,5,Great tasting cookie!,I really enjoyed the Quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie.  It's true...it tastes homemade!  Great for on the go when you need a treat or even for the kid's lunch boxes.
2029,B007JFMH8M,5,delish!!,Cookies are soft and so good! Taste just like a regular cookie! I received cookie complimentary from influenster in my mombox and was delighted with how good it was.
2030,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious and Nutritious,These new Quaker Oat Soft Baked Cookies are amazing! Soft and chewy. Very fresh and like they were just baked the day you bought them. My kids love them and it's a great way to give them their whole gains with a small serving of fruit. They are also great to pack in for a snack or a low calorie desert at 170 calories per cookie! I love these and will continue to purchase!
2031,B007JFMH8M,4,SOOOOOOOOO GOod!,"OMG....these are so good, better than I thought, they actually do taste home made, and I gotta say they taste even better than my grandmothers, sorry grams...:) I will definetly try these again, I got lucky and got to try a delicious sample from the influenster team :) I love quaker, and influenster.com"
2032,B007JFMH8M,5,DELICIOUS AND LIGHT,I recieved this cookie FREE FROM INFLUENSTER.COM in their MOM VOXBOX 2012 THEME PRODUCT TESTING. and omg i loved it. it was soft and didnt taste so filling. it was light and great flavor tasting  i loved it
2033,B007JFMH8M,4,Very Big and Tasty,Cookie is great and tasty. Tastes fresh. Very large in comparison to others related to the category. Very yummy. Will buy again.
2034,B007JFMH8M,5,Can we have this for breakfast?,"I received a sample of this product for free to test from Influenster and Quaker.  The cookie did not last long and I ended up going out to buy a whole new box.<br /><br />My son is three and he said the cookie tasted ""kind of like a muffin"" and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day.  The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for 10 seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren't individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  They are pretty great!  Oh, and they're not bad nutritionally... so go ahead and eat one for breakfast... I won't tell."
2035,B007JFMH8M,5,Best Oatmeal Cookies EVER!!!,"These are the best oatmeal cookies ever! They're so soft and yummy. My whole family loves them,and I have a pretty picky family."
2036,B007JFMH8M,5,Best cookies ever!,"I love these cookies! They are so soft and my daughter eats them without any problems.I am a big oatmeal cookie fan, but quakers are the best brand so far."

2038,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious Soft Cookie,I tried the Oatmeal Raisin cookie and it was delicious.  The cookie is fairly big which is great.  It is soft and chewy so you don't have to worry about crumbs getting all over the place if your on the go.  I have already bought more!
2039,B007JFMH8M,5,Like homemade...,"Well, if you ask my son, he might tell you it's better than his mommy's homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. :/ He loves the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and says they are ""Soft, chewy and Yummy!"" I'll be buying more!"
2040,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and chewy,"I Tried these after receiving a free sample from influencer.com, and they were delicious. Soft and chewy, with the perfect amount of raisins. They're a great size too. I will definitely buy some when they're available on amazon. My toddler loves them too."
2041,B007JFMH8M,4,Yummy,I found these cookies really moist and yummy. Good size and perfect for a snack break or for breakfast. My girls really liked them too. They remind of home made cookies. Good way to snack healthy.
2042,B007JFMH8M,5,Great taste,Loved my Quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good
2043,B007JFMH8M,5,tasty good for you treat,I really loved this cookie. It was soft and a bit chewy. I think that if I had not read the box I would not think they are good for you. Definitley a treat worth trying. I was totally satisfied and wished more came in a box!
2044,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker cookies are the bomb,I received this product in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. I have tried other Quaker products and loved them. These were just as good as the rest. I love how soft and chewy this oatmeal cookie was. The raisins were nice and juicy as well. I can't wait to grab a bigger size box or bag or whatever they may come in. It is well worth it.
2045,B007JFMH8M,5,Love it,"I receive those cookies for review i love the flavor and all of it, i recommend 100%, my family love too, thanks quaker oatmeal cookier you are part of my family now!"

2047,B007JFMH8M,4,Great snack....very delicious!,"I was able to try this product through Influenster in my Mom Voxbox.  I had to share it with my 2 year old daughter since you can't eat cookies in front of kids lol!  It was delicious and soft baked, just like home made cookies.  My only complaint is that my cookie didn't have a good amount of raisins in it.  Maybe I just got a batch that missed a few extra raisins but I definitely felt that it could've used more.  Other than that, it was a great snack, especially to serve to kids!!  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)"
2048,B007JFMH8M,5,DELISH!,I am so surprised these are healthy because they taste so darn good. They are packed with flavors and the best party- they are deliciously chewy! I will be buying these immediately my next trip to the grocery store. My three year old loved it!
2049,B007JFMH8M,5,Yumminess,I received this sample in my Influenster MOMVOXBOX and I must say I wish I had gotten more than just one cookie.  It was delicious.  Shared it with my husband and he liked equally as well.  Very moist and flavorful.
2050,B007JFMH8M,5,Loving Quaker Oats,I really enjoy Quaker oats in the mornings. The best part of my morning is sitting down to a nice hot bowl.
2051,B007JFMH8M,5,All that's missing is Grandma!,"I was able to enjoy this cookie because I received it in my VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie definitely does not skimp on any qualities a cookie should have. It was soft, chewy, fresh tasting and delicious. It is perfect for a quick breakfast or a quick snack or a yummy dessert with some ice cream. I will definitely be purchasing this item more often!"
2052,B007JFMH8M,5,My 11 month old ate it up!!!,"I received the chocolate and almond Quaker oatmeal cookie free to try from #influenster in my #MomVoxBox, my 11 month old LOVED it!! She couldn't get enough of it, and it was soft enough that I didn't have to worry about her choking on it :) That's always a plus, I had to go out and buy more  so swhe could eat them!!"
2053,B007JFMH8M,5,so delicious,"I got this sample from influenster and I loved it. It was soft, not too sweet and the texture and taste were perfect."

2055,B007JFMH8M,5,Amazing!!,"I didn't even know these existed until I received them in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. Luckily only one of my children was with me when I opened it. We shared the Oatmeal Raisin cookie, and we both thought it was wonderful! So much so, that I went out and found them at our grocery store. Try them warmed! Nice size, and very soft and chewy. So yummy!! I really would like to try the different flavors as well. A very tasty product!!"
2056,B007JFMH8M,5,Great,"I loved these cookies so much, they where nice and soft which I love in a cookie. They did not skimp on any flavor at all, I would buy these again and again."
2057,B007JFMH8M,5,kids loves it,my kids love the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie. i was amazed they love a healthier cookie. i love it because its a healthy alternative and its made out of oatmeal.
2058,B007JFMH8M,4,Kids LOVED it!,I was able to try this product because Influenster sent it to me in their #MomVoxBox for testing. Honestly I wasn't able to try it personally because my kids snatched it from me ha ha! But they enjoyed it a lot. They asked me if I would buy more and in different flavors too. Good and hearty snack for kids indeed! Thanks!
2059,B007JFMH8M,5,A Spoonful of Sugar!,"Oatmeal and raisins are healthy, right? Put them in cookie form and I've tricked my little toddler into a healthy snack that she thinks is a treat. These were really soft and flavorful. Definitely would buy again."
2060,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Oatmeal Cookie,"This is my first time trying this cookie. Its very soft, delicious, love the raisins. I will be buying theses for a snack for breakfast. I told all my friends to try this product."

2062,B007JFMH8M,5,Tasty and Healthy,"These cookies are absolutely amazing. My three year doesnt like a lot of snacks and cookies and hes very picky, but he likes a couple of these flavors. They are very soft and very delicious and extremely tasty, you almost forget that they are healthy for you. I absolutely love quaker oatmeal and these cookies are an extra treat."
2063,B007JFMH8M,4,Yum Yum,"From a he said she said point of view...<br /><br />He: (Who likes soft cookies) Thought they were good, chewy,  moist and delicious.<br /><br />She: (Who prefers a more crunchy cookie) I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it, taste was okay you could tell you were eating a whole grain cookie. The raisins saved this cookie for me.<br /><br />Over all we like Quaker Oats, we would buy this cookie if we has a coupon but not as a number one on our list."
2064,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies-yum!,"I was excited to receive a package of Quaker Soft Baked Cookies through Influenster to try out.

2068,B007JFMH8M,5,Some of the best soft baked cookies I have had in awhie,"I was choosen as one of @Influensters Mom VoxBox recipients. I was excited about that, but I was even more excited when I opened it to see that there was a Quaker Oatmeal soft baked cookie inside. I immediately opened it. It's one of the softest and most delicious cookies I have had in a long time. I immediately had two of my kids try a piece of it also. They loved it also! These cookies are rich in flavor, not dry, and all around a great cookie. I went out yesterday and bought two more boxes of them. These are a great product to keep handy for snack time! Absolutely love them!"
2069,B007JFMH8M,4,Good soft baked cookie,This cookie is good the only thing I had a problem with is that it's soft. Duh I know it says soft baked I'm so used to eating the hard oatmeal raisin cookie. I will purchase this in the future and will recommend.

2089,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious for Both Kids and Adults!,"My son and I both loved Quaker's Soft Baked cookies! I received a sample in the Mom VoxBox via Influenster. I've never been a fan of the hard type cookies so I loved how soft and chewy these ones were. Since my son is still a toddler, I think they were soft enough for him and his little teeth to chew and eat. Plus they were just plain delicious!"
2090,B007JFMH8M,5,My son loves it!!,I received this product from influenster in my mom voxbox 2012 to test out. My grab grabbed the cookie of the box and hid...he has been begging me for more ever since. Unfortunately they don't sell them in m local grocery store yet but next time I go out of town I plan on purchasing more!!!

2093,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Cookie!!,I recieved this product for free to test from Influenster for promotional reasons. Me and my daughters ages 4 and 7 all tried the cookie and we loved it. It taste great and it really is soft. My local store didnt have The Quaker SOft baked oatmeal raisin cookie so I bought the breakfast version of it and I love it as well. The cookies are great for all ages!!! I would recommend this cookie to people.
2094,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies Make my Daughter's Day!,"I was selected by Influenster to get a mom Voxbox.  Inside with other products I got a full size sample of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies.  My daughter was so happy with it.  I was able to steal a small amount from her...It was so yummy and soft.  It was a nice size too. It was not small at all and you will get your moneys worth.  The fact that it has oatmeal is a plus, meaning my kids are putting something healthy in them when they are snacking.  I will definetely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone.  If you want a yummy soft cookie with lots of flavor with none of the work and clean up after baking...go get a box of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies...you won't be sorry. :-) I know my kids are happy that I tryed it....Thanks again Influenster and Quaker."
2095,B007JFMH8M,4,very soft great tasting cookie!,I recieved one as a sample but I will now be buying these cookies from now on! Oh and the kids also loved them!

And it really is so soft, if feels and tastes fresh baked. I only have one question, what took them so long to make these?? =) Really they are so good you wonder why they haven't thought of this years ago!<br />Here are a few of the details! They are individually packaged, so they are great for on the go! They are made with yummy whole grain Quaker oats! They are a good source of fiber and only have 6 grams of total fat per serving! I know you are dying to know where you can get these now! You can buy them at pretty much any major retailers and have a suggested retail of $2.69 for 6 cookies, That's less than $0.50 a cookie! Great deal! Give them a try and let me know how you like tem!"
2098,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,"I love all of Quaker's products and so I didn't expect anything less from these cookies. I was not disappointed. The cookies are soft, chewy, and filling. They have the right amount of cinnamon and rasins in them. My kids even like them which is hard when it comes to oatmeal. I would definitely recommend these cookies if you love oatmeal rasin cookies."
2099,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy and Filling,"I already loved Quaker products, I grew up on them. This did not disappoint. Its a soft cookie, its a fulfilling treat and it has fiber :)"

2103,B007JFMH8M,5,So Good,"I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster to try-then immediately went out and bought 2 more boxes, which are now gone also. These cookies have such a great homebaked consistency and just the right amount of spice and sugar. My kids love them too, especially when we cut them in half and put a little ice cream between the halves."

2106,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins is very good. Nice and soft. Easy to break into smaller pieces to eat. Highly recommend trying this product."
2107,B007JFMH8M,5,Just like Grandma used to make,My whole family enjoyed the yummy goodness of Quaker oatmeal cookies with raisins. My 3 year old couldn't get enough of them. It reminded me of my grandma's home made cookies. The taste brought me back to my childhood when I would help my grandma bake. So soft and I could taste the wholesome goodness in each bite. I will be buying more soon!
2108,B007JFMH8M,5,Great Healthy Snack,I received this from influenster in my mom voxbox and my kids loved this cookie. I didn't even get a chance to try it and had to purchase a box. I highly recommend this cookie... Its a great snack and a healthier one!!!!
2109,B007JFMH8M,5,So good!,The Quaker Brand soft cookies are so good! They are yummy and soft and really fill you up! So easy on the go with the kids or if your just relaxing at home with some milk!
2110,B007JFMH8M,5,nummy,"These are so yummy,my son loves them. As a mother I feel good about giving this to my son for a snack"
2111,B007JFMH8M,5,Loved these cookies,"I recieved them in my influenster mom voxbox, and before I can try it my kids ate it!. They loved them, they have been asking me to go to the store and get some more. Looks like tomorrow I'm going shopping."
2112,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy Goodness,"I didn't get a chance to eat this cookie, but my 5 year old absolutely loved it.  She said that is was very yummy, soft and good.  She wanted more.  I told that we would get more..."
2113,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"These cookies are delicious! So soft and flavorful. My fave! My first time trying these cookies was a couple of weeks ago, and I will defiantly recommend."
2114,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious cookie,"Such a tasty cookie... soft, flavorful.  Mmm.<br /><br />I was highly surprised at how good these were.  Yum!  The portion was quite generous, making for a nice afternoon snack."
2115,B007JFMH8M,3,Goes good with milk :),My kids really like to eat the quaker oatmeal soft cookies in the morning<br /> for breakfest with a big glass of milk! :)
2116,B007JFMH8M,4,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie,"My whole family loved this cookie! It is very soft and tastes great! It was so soft that my 8 month old even got to enjoy it, too!"
2117,B007JFMH8M,4,Soft and Chewy but Breaks Apart easily,"The cookie is soft and flavorful. It tastes good and the raisins are moist. My only complaint is the the cookie didn't stay together. It breaks apart very easily,"
2118,B007JFMH8M,5,Delicious,I really loved the taste of these cookies. They tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies. They seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies. I used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind. I would definitely buy these again.
2119,B007JFMH8M,5,kids love them,"i like to buy them for my kids they love them and theyre also good for them, they are soft and chewy healthy and the taste is great"
2120,B007JFMH8M,5,Worth the try!,These cookies are amazing! Great for snacks for the children. Nutritious yet satisfying. Will keep purchasing more of these. Amazing great taste.
2121,B007JFMH8M,5,Delish,"What a great snack for on the run, in a purse or diaper bag, or even for a quick treat at home! Was delicious and pretty healthy compared to some cookies!"
2122,B007JFMH8M,5,Great for on the moms and they taste delicious!,"We tried the soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies and fell in love with them! Being a mom and constantly on the go its hard to find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag, purse, lunch box or car. I would recommend these to every one:)"
2123,B007JFMH8M,5,Yum!,I shared these with my toddler. We both loved them. They are soft and practically melt in your mouth. They are so soft and delicious. The fact that they are healthy also helps and makes me feel great about giving them to my kids.
2124,B007JFMH8M,5,Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies...Too Good to Last better buy 2 boxes at least!,"As Soon as I received my sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox from influenster.com my 2 yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why. They taste very fresh and everyone loves them!<br />I got to try this product for free in my MomVoxBox from Influenster.com<br />I'm an Influenster and Influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!"
2125,B007JFMH8M,2,"OK Taste, But Too Many Questionable Ingredients","Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies."
2126,B007JFMH8M,3,Not For  Weight Watchers,"I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with."
2127,B007JFMH8M,3,Nothing to get excited about,"I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range."
2128,B007JFMH8M,4,Great Classic Cookies,"When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from Quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+"
2129,B007JFMH8M,4,"Not Your Grandma's Cookies, But They Get The Job Done","I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings."
2130,B007JFMH8M,1,"Average Taste, Bad Calories, Insanely long list of ingredients","The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?"
2131,B007JFMH8M,2,~~meh~~,Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.
2132,B007JFMH8M,5,yummy!,I must admit this was one great product. Not only did I enjoy these my son's did as well . They were a big hit today at my sons birthday party and I intend to keep purchasing!! Great job!
2133,B007JFMH8M,5,delicious,I receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious I have never tried these but I would recommend them to anyone
2134,B007JFMH8M,5,"Very Good, Very Natural Tasting, Great Texture","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:14 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway."
2135,B007JFMH8M,5,I can't believe these are not homemade!,"I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!"
2136,B007JFMH8M,5,"So good, and my toddler loved it(:","I loved this cookie! I received it in my mom vox box from influenster, and that was the first thing me and my daughter tried. (: She absolutely loved it, and I will be buying more and put them in my diaper bag, for on the go trips (:"
2137,B007JFMH8M,5,DELICIOUS COOKIES,"Hello, I received this cookie in my @influenster Mom VoxBox to review and i have to say i was very pleased with the taste, texture and the enormous size of the cookie. I am happy with Quaker Products, i always have been ever since i was little. I now pass the nutritional products to my children as my grandma passed it on to me."
2138,B007JFMH8M,5,On the go goodness,"I like the cookies while on the go.  They are soft and chewy and have the goodness of Quaker products.  If you don't have time to bake, then give these cookies a try.  They taste great.  I sampled the product thanks to Influenster and I am so thankful for that!"

2141,B007JFMH8M,5,Chewy Yummies Without Work,"I received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box. These are super soft cookies that are individually wrapped for convenience. The individually wrapped cookie is a huge feature here as the cookies stay fresh and soft in a easily tote-able package. You get the great taste of Quaker oat cookies without the work of baking them! Toss in the kids lunch bag, spouse lunch box, pack for a picnic, use in birthday party favor bags for a healthy alternative! Great tasting, great portability, great texture. love them!!"

2146,B007JFMH8M,5,Like Homemade!,I have fallen in love with Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie! I tried them in my mom voxbox from Influenster and it was so good. It tasted like a homemade cookie to me. I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the Quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend Quaker.

2149,B007JFMH8M,5,So Yummy!,"I received this amazing Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom VoxBox. I'm normally not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies since I don't like raisins, but this was delicious! The cookie was thick and tasted homemade with a nice oatmeal flavor. I'm definitely going to buy more of these."
2150,B007JFMH8M,3,Good cookie,"I got this from Influenster in my mom voxbox,  it was very soft and tasty my husband said, as he was the one who ate it lol!"
2151,B007JFMH8M,4,Really Good,"I got these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, and they were really good. They were moist and yummy. I don't like raisins so I picked them out, but the oatmeal was amazing. I will definitely buy some more. Well, a flavor without raisins in them."

2154,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take ""on-the-go"" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains 6 grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain Quaker Oats! You can't beat that! Try them out, I'm sure you'll love them as much as I did! =D"
2155,B007JFMH8M,5,Just Like Mom Used to Make....,The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.
2156,B007JFMH8M,1,ehh,"My kids or I didn't care for it much, they tossed it after a few bites, and what kids throw away cookies????"
2157,B007JFMH8M,1,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins","If I could give it zero stars I would......horrible taste and not much of that either. Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives Quaker a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment...."
2158,B007JFMH8M,4,Tastes Great,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others."
2159,B007JFMH8M,5,Very nice cookie,"I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again."
2160,B007JFMH8M,5,love this cookie!,"this cookie is super soft and chewy.i love it and also try their oatmeal cookies,they are the bomb diggitty!!!i would recommend this to everyone.i received this in my mom voxbox and my kids loved it!!"
2161,B007JFMH8M,3,An OK Cookie,"These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one."
2162,B007JFMH8M,5,AWESOME,THIS IS A FAB PRODUCT SOFT AND CHEWY YOU CANT GO WRONG ME AND MY KIDS LOVE THEM MY TWO YEAR OLD IS HARD FOR HIM TO SHARE HE SAYS NO MY COOKIE LOL
2163,B007JFMH8M,5,Yummy!,"I loved these cookies and so did my kids. You can read my full review here [...] My favorite part was definitely the taste, and I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan."
2164,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies,This is a great tasting cookie. It is very soft and the texture is very smooth. I usually do not like oatmeal cookies because the texture is very gritty and tough. This cookie does not have that problem. It tastes like your Mom just made it.
2165,B007JFMH8M,4,Delicious!,"These are great for a quick snack! They are satisfying even if you have a sweet tooth. I love that they are whole grain and have fiber! Delicious, just wish there weren't raisins in them!"
2166,B007JFMH8M,5,yummy,"I love the Quaker soft baked cookies.  The really are soft and taste great.  I tried the oatmeal raisin, and cant wait to try the other flavors.  They all look really good."
2167,B007JFMH8M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Cookie,This cookie is really good and works really well for my family.  In the morning it fits in to my morning routine.  I take the cookie put it in the microwave and out the door we go with my tea.  Something I can eat at my desk or on the run.  It holds me over till lunch and is not too heavy.
